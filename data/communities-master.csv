Genetic and morphological results are discordant, but at least one species of Chydaekata is known only from this community based on both morphological and genetic characters. Species within Chydaekata are all of the family Paramelitidae, the largest family of Australian inland amphipods. Australian Crangonyctoid amphipoda are ancient fauna, probably predating the break up of Pangaea, and are bound to regions that have not been inundated by the sea since the Cretaceous.  The fact that these stygofauna are restricted to permanent fresh underground waters in the arid region, is presumed to be either as the result of being driven into refugia by climatic deterioration, or being the relict survivors of a once more extensive fauna (Bradbury 2000).",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Unknown,Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,,N/A,N/A,,,,3738,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Contracting (pressures > recovery actions),GAS03 3007ha + PIL03 731ha,Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Expert opinion,Pilbara workshop: dewatering,Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Expert opinion,Pilbara workshop: dewatering,Stygofauna,,,None,Endangered,2001,CR/EN - Bii) EOO limited and few occurrences which are small and isolated and subject to threatening processes,near endemic to GAS03,"Pastoral lease, Unallocated crown land, Freehold land, Other public lands - roads and water bodies",2010,,"Only one known occurrence of this community.

The fact that these stygofauna are restricted to permanent fresh underground waters in the arid region, is presumed to be either as the result of being driven into refugia by climatic deterioration, or being the relict survivors of a once more extensive fauna (Bradbury 2000).",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Unknown,Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,,N/A,N/A,,,,3738,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Contracting (pressures > recovery actions),GAS03 3007ha + PIL03 731ha,Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Expert opinion,Pilbara workshop: dewatering,Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Unknown,Worsening condition (pressures > recovery actions),Expert opinion,Pilbara workshop: dewatering,Vascular plants,,,None,Endangered,2001,CR/EN - Bii) EOO limited and few occurrences which are small and isolated and subject to threatening processes,near endemic to GAS03,"Pastoral lease, Unallocated crown land, Freehold land, Other public lands - roads and water bodies",2010,,"Only one known occurrence of this community.

Western Australia,South Coast,Montane Thicket of the eastern Stirling Range,Montane,"Montane Thicket and Heath of the South West Botanical Province, above approximately 900m above sea level. In the eastern Stirling Range a montane community distinct from that occurring in the central and western Stirling Range is found at high altitudes. The community structure is or was typically that of a dense heath or thicket with scrub vegetation on skeletal soils. Factors affecting plant growth include low temperatures and high wind speeds that prevail for much of the year. A key species indicative of its distribution is Andersonia axilliflora, which is or was an abundant and dominant member of the community. Using A. axilliflora as an indicator, the community extends from the eastern limit of the Stirling Range, Ellen Peak, more or less continuously at high altitudes to Coyanarup Peak, with a separate occurrence on the summit area of Mt Success. Other species that characterise the community include Kunzea montana, Beaufortia anisandra, Sphenotoma sp. Stirling Range, Andersonia echinocephala and Darwinia spp. A range of proteaceous species were or are structurally significant and include Banksia oreophila, Banksia solandri, Banksia brownii and Dryandra concinna.",5,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,"S&C 4 occurrences, S Barrett mapped 5 2013",1920,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets extent of occurrence criteria for CR) ",Minimum convex polygon of records in DPaW corporate database,Contracting (new knowledge - delineation/mapping),Barrett & Yates 2014.

In the eastern Stirling Range a montane community distinct from that occurring in the central and western Stirling Range is found at high altitudes. The community structure is or was typically that of a dense heath or thicket with scrub vegetation on skeletal soils. Factors affecting plant growth include low temperatures and high wind speeds that prevail for much of the year. A key species indicative of its distribution is Andersonia axilliflora, which is or was an abundant and dominant member of the community. Using A. axilliflora as an indicator, the community extends from the eastern limit of the Stirling Range, Ellen Peak, more or less continuously at high altitudes to Coyanarup Peak, with a separate occurrence on the summit area of Mt Success. Other species that characterise the community include Kunzea montana, Beaufortia anisandra, Sphenotoma sp. Stirling Range, Andersonia echinocephala and Darwinia spp. A range of proteaceous species were or are structurally significant and include Banksia oreophila, Banksia solandri, Banksia brownii and Dryandra concinna.",5,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,"S&C 4 occurrences, S Barrett mapped 5 2013",1920,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets extent of occurrence criteria for CR) ",Minimum convex polygon of records in DPaW corporate database,Contracting (new knowledge - delineation/mapping),Barrett & Yates 2014.

Western Australia,Southwest,Rimstone Pools and Cave Structures Formed by Microbial Activity on Marine Shorelines,Augusta-microbial,"The term microbialites has been used to describe structures produced through the growth and metabolic activity of benthic microbial communities. It encompasses stromatolites, thrombolites, tufa, travetines, algal nodules and algal biscuits.

Western Australia,Swan,Aquatic Root Mat Community Number 1 of Caves of the Swan Coastal Plain,CAVES SCP01,"At Yanchep and on the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge, permanent streams and pools occur in caves and some support dense growths of root mats. The root mats provide a constant and abundant primary food source for some of the richest aquatic cave communities known. The communities comprise a complete food web; the rootlets and their associated microflora providing the primary food source, and invertebrate assemblages including root mat grazers, predators, parasites, detritivores and scavengers, completing the trophic interactions. The roots from living Tuart trees branch out forming root mats in permanent cave streams. The aquatic rootlets contain extensive growths of microscopic fungi within their tissues which probably increase the nutritional value of the mats (Jasinska, 1995). The root mats house more than 50 percent of the animals that occur in any one cave stream at Yanchep (Jasinska, 1995).

Western Australia,Swan,Stromatolite like freshwater microbialite community of coastal brackish lakes,Clifton-microbialite,"Thrombolite community formed by biologically influenced precipitation of aragonite in a coastal brackish lake (Lake Clifton). The community occurs on a relict foredune plain on Holocene sands at Lake Clifton, southwest of Mandurah and is a complex association of photosynthetic cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria, eukaryotic microalgae and what are known as ‘true bacteria’. Thrombolitic structures (those that have an internal clotted structure as opposed to those that have a laminated organisation which are stromatolitic) are formed through precipitation of calcium carbonate within the microenvironment of microbes as a result of photosynthetic and metabolic activity. The major process in the formation of the thrombolites is the precipitation of aragonite in a microenvironment determined by bacteria Scytonema sp. and other members of the BMC such as microalgae, in a process of biologically-influenced mineralization (Moore and Burne, 1994). The filamentous cyanobacteria Scytonema seculum is a dominant and oher cyanobacteria in the BMC include Oscillatoria, Dichothrix, Choococcus, Gleocapsa, Johannesbaptista, Gomphosphaeria and Spirulina. The eukaryotes include suite is composed of diatoms and macroalgae. The diatoms can live together with the BMC or as phytoplankton and the macroalgae has epiphytic or periphytic habits (Burne and Moore, 1994).",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Static (no change),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,JM:included in Audit 1,N/A,N/A,,,,504,"< 1,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Unknown,S&C: area of occupancy from IRP but trend not included.

Western Australia,Swan,"Communities of Tumulus Springs (Organic Mound Springs, Swan Coastal Plain)",Mound Springs SCP,"The habitat of this community is characterised by continuous discharge of groundwater in raised areas of peat. The peat and surrounds provide a stable, permanently moist series of microhabitats. The springs are associated with a high level of heterogeneity of invertebrate fauna assemblages. Groups commonly represented to date include Ostracoda, Nematoda, Cladocera, Copepoda, Oligochaeta, Tardigrada, Turbellaria and Insecta.

Typical and common native vascular plant species associated with the tumulus springs are the trees Banksia littoralis, Melaleuca preissiana and Eucalyptus rudis, and the shrubs Agonis linearifolia, Pteridium esculentum, Astartea fascicularis and Cyclosorus interruptus. The following non-vascular plants have also been located on peat mounds associated with the community: Lycopodium serpentium (bog clubmoss), Riccardia aequicellularis, Jungermannia inundata, Goebelobryum unguiculatum and Hyalolepidozia longiscypha.

Common weed species include Isolepis prolifera and Pennisetum clandestinum.",8,Less than or equal to 10 (potentially meets location criteria VU),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge -

Western Australia,Swan,Stromatolite like microbialite community of coastal freshwater lakes,Richmond-microbial,"This community occurs on the relic foredune plain on Holocene sands at Lake Richmond, Rockingham and is a complex association of photosynthetic cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria, eukaryotic microalgae and ‘true bacteria’. Thrombolitic structures (those that have an internal clotted structure as opposed to those that have a laminated organisation which are stromatolitic) are formed through precipitation of calcium carbonate within the microenvironment of microbes as a result of photosynthetic and metabolic activity. These microbes are likely to include cyanobacteria dominated by Dichothrix sp., and other photosynthetic bacteria that depend on light for growth and survival. The source of the calcium in the waters of Lake Richmond is probably groundwater that has passed through sand dunes that surround the lake. The sands are calcareous and composed of quartz sands and shell debris of Aeolian origin (deposited by the wind).

SWA02,Swan,Stromatolite like microbialite community of coastal freshwater lakes,Richmond-microbial,"This community occurs on the relic foredune plain on Holocene sands at Lake Richmond, Rockingham and is a complex association of photosynthetic cyanobacteria and purple sulphur bacteria, eukaryotic microalgae and ‘true bacteria’. Thrombolitic structures (those that have an internal clotted structure as opposed to those that have a laminated organisation which are stromatolitic) are formed through precipitation of calcium carbonate within the microenvironment of microbes as a result of photosynthetic and metabolic activity. These microbes are likely to include cyanobacteria dominated by Dichothrix sp., and other photosynthetic bacteria that depend on light for growth and survival. The source of the calcium in the waters of Lake Richmond is probably groundwater that has passed through sand dunes that surround the lake. The sands are calcareous and composed of quartz sands and shell debris of Aeolian origin (deposited by the wind).

Western Australia,Swan,Herb rich saline shrublands in clay pans ,SCP07,"This community is generally dominated by Melaleuca viminea, M. uncinata, M. cuticularis or Casuarina obesa or a mixture of these species. This community occurs on heavy clay soils that are generally inundated from winter into mid summer. The species composition (Melaleuca cuticularis and Casuarina obesa) may indicate some saline influence for at least some part of the year. Common herbs such as Brachyscome bellidioides, Centrolepis polygyna, Pogonolepis stricta and Cotula coronopifolia are typical of this community. In addition species such as Angianthus drummondii, Eryngium pinnatifidum subsp. palustre, and Blennospora drummondii occur in this community in low frequency. A suite of annual flora is seen in this community type as the season progresses. In early spring many of the occurrences of this threatened community are covered by free water up to 30 cm deep. Cotula coronopifolia sometimes forms yellow floating mats in some pools while others may be dominated by Villarsia submersa. Aquatic species are common in this community type early in the growing season. As the wetland dries a succession of species such as Centrolepis spp. and annual Stylidium spp. successively germinate, grow and flower, resulting in an extended flowering period of over three months.

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of the organic springs and mound springs of Mandora Marsh area,Mandora Mounds,"Assemblages of flora and fauna associated with the organic spring and mound spring wetland ecosystems of Mandora Marsh area in the southern Dampierland and Great Sandy Desert Bioregions, 200 km south of Broome.  These wetland ecosystems comprise spring-fed swamps with peaty substrates, many of which form raised peat mounds over the source of the spring. The wetlands vary in size from 0.1 ha to several hectares.  Water samples analysed from several mound springs ranged from fresh to brackish; brackish springs tend to be closer to the main lake and therefore lower in the landscape (Storey et al. in prep.). Approximately 15 million years ago the Mandora Marsh area was part of a large drainage system called the Wallal Paleoriver.  The distribution of mound springs appears linked to calcrete development along the paleodrainage line.  While unconfirmed, it has been suggested that the springs have developed where disruption of the calcrete layer has occurred allowing groundwater to come to the surface (Graham 1999). 
Plant assemblages associated with these ecosystems include paperbark Melaleuca leucadendra or M. cajuputi forest with or without an understorey of mangrove ferns Acrostichum speciosum, and/or  dragon tree Sesbania formosa woodland with or without an understorey of mangrove ferns.  Also present are stands of the bullrush Typha domingensis and sedgelands dominated by Schoenoplectus spp. with Fimbristylis spp., along with patches of the grass Sporobolus virginicus.  In addition, a few mangroves Avicennia marina occur on the more brackish springs.  Some Acacia ampliceps is often present in the mid-storey but is not abundant.  Typha domingensis and sedges with a few emergent trees or mangroves dominate the vegetation on some of the small mound springs.  Not only is the dominant vegetation of the various springs variable between occurrences, it is variable over time as the area is frequently subject to cyclonic winds that physically damage the vegetation.  In particular, cyclones knock down the tree canopy permitting the mangrove fern understorey to dominate until the tree canopy recovers.
The aquatic invertebrate fauna of the springs is relatively depauperate in comparison with other studies. The Insecta are characterised by species with strong-flying adult stages, promoting efficient dispersion, and as such, the macroinvertebrates contained few taxa with limited distributions or endemicity to the area. The majority of endemic taxa were recorded from the microinvertbrate fauna, but diversity and levels of endemism were relatively low compared to other detailed fauna surveys.  However, Assiminea sp. nov is new to science and is endemic to these springs and two of the Mandora rotifers are new (a Brachionus related to the cosmotropical B. budapestinensis, and a Cephalodella close to the South American C. boettgeri.).  While the cladoceran (Branchiopoda: Anomopoda/Ctenopoda) representation in the microfauna is depauperate relative to other W.A. studies and Australia in general, with only five taxa identified from the Mandora series.  However, four of the five taxa collected are probably endemic, although regional distribution on a continental basis is not known (Storey et al. in prep.).  Further results of invertebrate fauna identification are pending.
Preliminary comparisons of invertebrate fauna from mound springs of the Mandora Marsh area with other mound springs further north in the Kimberley Region, show that the fauna of the Kimberley mound springs is substantially richer, and that very few species are common to both areas. Some components of the Kimberley mound spring fauna (eg. Ostracods and Copepods) have a strong Asian element, and in general these springs support a distinctive high-rainfall Kimberley fauna, while the Mandora Marsh mound springs host fauna more typical of the arid Pilbara region (S.

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of Dragon Tree Soak organic mound spring,Dragon Tree Soak,"Dragon Tree Soak is an organic mound spring which comprises a permanent swamp and soak of black peaty mud, surrounded by an irregular dampland of grey loam flat and claypan.  At its centre, this wetland supports a closed sedgeland of jointed twig-rush Baumea articulata, at 2.5 m high and 95% canopy cover. The dragon tree Sesbania formosa occurs as a sparse emergent and some clumps of the bullrush Typha domingensis are also present in the centre of the soak. At the southern and northern ends of the swamp is a low-closed forest/scrub of Sesbania formosa, averaging 10 m in height, with some Typha domingensis understorey. In wet areas on the periphery of the swamp, a grassland of Paspalum vaginatum (couch grass) occurs, with sparse emergent Fimbristylis ferruginea. The slightly higher and drier surrounding flats support Sporobolus virginicus, Acacia ampliceps and Melaleuca glomerata.  The priority (P3) sedge species Fimbristylis sieberiana also occurs at Dragon Tree Soak.  Dragon Tree Soak is an example of an oasis within a major desert. It is a rare wetland landform, and a rare ecosystem, supporting plants and animals that are absent or scarce elsewhere in the bioregion. Due to its peaty sediments, Dragon Tree Soak is an important research site for studies of paleo-climate in north-western Australia. Carbon datings and pollen records from core samples indicate continued uninterrupted deposition of peat at the site for at least the last 6000 years, pointing to general climatic stability.",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but not sure when community has been recently visited,N/A,N/A,,,,7941,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Unknown,Kimberley workshop: NMc advised the mapped area is evaporaite flats and area of soak is small.

The dragon tree Sesbania formosa occurs as a sparse emergent and some clumps of the bullrush Typha domingensis are also present in the centre of the soak. At the southern and northern ends of the swamp is a low-closed forest/scrub of Sesbania formosa, averaging 10 m in height, with some Typha domingensis understorey. In wet areas on the periphery of the swamp, a grassland of Paspalum vaginatum (couch grass) occurs, with sparse emergent Fimbristylis ferruginea. The slightly higher and drier surrounding flats support Sporobolus virginicus, Acacia ampliceps and Melaleuca glomerata.  The priority (P3) sedge species Fimbristylis sieberiana also occurs at Dragon Tree Soak.  Dragon Tree Soak is an example of an oasis within a major desert. It is a rare wetland landform, and a rare ecosystem, supporting plants and animals that are absent or scarce elsewhere in the bioregion. Due to its peaty sediments, Dragon Tree Soak is an important research site for studies of paleo-climate in north-western Australia. Carbon datings and pollen records from core samples indicate continued uninterrupted deposition of peat at the site for at least the last 6000 years, pointing to general climatic stability.",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but not sure when community has been recently visited,N/A,N/A,,,,7941,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Unknown,Kimberley workshop: NMc advised the mapped area is evaporaite flats and area of soak is small.

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of Bunda Bunda organic mound springs,Bunda Bunda,"Organic mound spring communities of Bunda Bunda, Dampierland Bioregion.  The site consists of an area of two organic mound springs on tidal mudflats in Carnot Bay on Dampier Peninsula north of Broome. These springs are approximately 200 m apart and about 300 m from the shore.  The peaty mounds rise c. 2-3 m above the surrounding tidal flats and are composed of accumulated leaf litter and living vegetation, supporting a dense rainforest (closed forest) and a tall shrubland respectively, each with mangroves in concentriform arrangement. The smaller mound is dry in the centre, but encircled by a moat, fed by permanent freshwater seepage. The larger mound is wet and incompletely ringed by a leptoscale channel or moat of variable depth which broadens to a microscale saline lake (300 m long, 50 m wide) on the north side. The moats and lake are saline and occasionally inundated during large tides.  The western end of the larger mound is covered by a very dense (closed) forest dominated by evergreen Carallia brachiata trees to 20 m and a bracken-like layer of the fern Cyclosorus interruptus (to 1 m). This is the most southerly population of Carallia in Western Australia. A few Timonius timon and dragon trees Sesbania formosa occur. The east end of the island is slightly lower, more moist and the leaf litter forms a 'spongier' substrate. It is covered by tall closed forest (to 20 m) of Melaleuca cajuputi, T. timon, S. formosa with fewer C. brachiata and an understorey of C. interruptus. Creepers including Cassytha filiformis and the broadleaved Secamone elliptic, drape from trees, and climbing Maidenhair Ferns Lygodium microphyllum form a curtain which filters the light.  In the moat-like channel surrounding the large mound are mangroves and the mangrove fern Acrostichum speciosum, with an occurrence of the uncommon mangrove Lumnitzera racemosa on the eastern side. An endemic (Kimberley) mistletoe, Amyema dolichopodum also occurs on the site. The two mounds differ from each other and there is considerable spatial variation in vegetation within each site. There is a clear zonation in the vegetation around the smaller south-western mound spring. It is fringed by a ring of mangroves, predominantly Rhizophora stylosa and Avicennia marina. Within this lies a band of mangrove fern Acrostichum speciosum and trees of cadjeput Melaleuca cajuputi and Timonius timon to 12 m. In the dry centre of the island is a tall shrubland dominated by Acacia neurocarpa to 5 m, over grasses and sedges. The mudflats around the two mounds are bare of vegetation, but a Sporobolus grassland grows closer to the shore.  One of the most southerly occurrences of rainforest in Western Australia. The rainforest species of this community are common to rainforest patches across northern Australia (many of which have much greater species diversity), but are unusual in such a seasonally arid environment.  The site provides an isolated refuge for rainforest and riparian plant species, as well as a cool microclimate and freshwater for birds and other fauna.  Carallia brachiata produces a large crop of red berries around October, which is a food source for several species of bird including the Channel-billed Cuckoo Scythrops novaehollandiae and Pheasant Coucal Centropus phasianinus.  Other birds feed on flowering mangroves.",2,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but community has not been recently visited,35,< 100ha (potentially meets extent of occurrence criteria for CR),Minimum convex polygon of records in DPaW corporate database,Unknown,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but community has not been recently visited,26,"< 1,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Unknown,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but community has not been recently visited,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but community has not been recently visited,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop: community known prior to 2002 but community has not been recently visited,wetland,,,None,Vulnerable,,VN - A) exists largely as modified occurrences capable of being rehabilitated or restored,DAL02,Unallocated crown land,2001,,"Notes from workshop: One site visited in 1999, one in 2001.

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of Walcott Inlet rainforest swamps,Walcott Inlet,"Tall closed-canopied swamp rainforest on the extensive floodplain that fringes a tidal mudflat in the Walcott Inlet.  McKenzie et al. (1990) sampled the 3 known occurrences of this community type, which, being on swampy terrain adjacent to sandstone ridges, was described as markedly different from other patches of rainforest.  Stoneman et al. (1991) described Patch 19/2 in detail.  The swamp is fed by streams from sandstone hills and appears to be part of a broad watercourse.  Water drains from the swamp towards the tidal mud flats.  At the time of survey (June 1987) there was free water to at least 30 cm deep in the central part of the swamp.  Higher ground with a tall Melaleuca forest occurs in the centre of the swamp area.  The soils are generally highly organic and in places composed of layers with different textures.  The vegetation comprises closed-canopy rainforest to 30 m in height, and is dominated by Ficus spp., Nauclea orientalis, and Celtis philippinensis over 1-3 m high Acrostychum speciosum (ferns).  During the Kimberley Rainforest Survey, the two species Cordia subcordata (tree) and Torresitrachia sp. (snail), were recorded once only, at Patch 19/2 (McKenzie and Belbin 1991).  The lithology of the 3 occurrences is Quaternary alluvium.  The subsurface soil is a black silty clay at 18/4, a black sandy clay loam at 19/2, and a very dark grey sandy loam at 21/4.  Respectively, leaf litter depths of 7, 10, and 10 cm were recorded during the Kimberley Rainforest Survey (McKenzie et al. (1991).  At Patches 18/4, 19/2 and 21/4, the height of the rainforest canopy is 15, 27, and 20 m respectively.  The Kimberley Rainforest Survey recorded perennial plant species richness at 31, 96, and 33; bird species richness at 20, 36, and 15; and, total species richness of 59, 142, and 57.

NOK01,Kimberley,Assemblages of Walcott Inlet rainforest swamps,Walcott Inlet,"Tall closed-canopied swamp rainforest on the extensive floodplain that fringes a tidal mudflat in the Walcott Inlet.  McKenzie et al. (1990) sampled the 3 known occurrences of this community type, which, being on swampy terrain adjacent to sandstone ridges, was described as markedly different from other patches of rainforest.  Stoneman et al. (1991) described Patch 19/2 in detail.  The swamp is fed by streams from sandstone hills and appears to be part of a broad watercourse.  Water drains from the swamp towards the tidal mud flats.  At the time of survey (June 1987) there was free water to at least 30 cm deep in the central part of the swamp.  Higher ground with a tall Melaleuca forest occurs in the centre of the swamp area.  The soils are generally highly organic and in places composed of layers with different textures.  The vegetation comprises closed-canopy rainforest to 30 m in height, and is dominated by Ficus spp., Nauclea orientalis, and Celtis philippinensis over 1-3 m high Acrostychum speciosum (ferns).  During the Kimberley Rainforest Survey, the two species Cordia subcordata (tree) and Torresitrachia sp. (snail), were recorded once only, at Patch 19/2 (McKenzie and Belbin 1991).  The lithology of the 3 occurrences is Quaternary alluvium.  The subsurface soil is a black silty clay at 18/4, a black sandy clay loam at 19/2, and a very dark grey sandy loam at 21/4.  Respectively, leaf litter depths of 7, 10, and 10 cm were recorded during the Kimberley Rainforest Survey (McKenzie et al. (1991).  At Patches 18/4, 19/2 and 21/4, the height of the rainforest canopy is 15, 27, and 20 m respectively.  The Kimberley Rainforest Survey recorded perennial plant species richness at 31, 96, and 33; bird species richness at 20, 36, and 15; and, total species richness of 59, 142, and 57.  Most of the camaenid land snails recorded in the Kimberley Rainforest Survey are restricted endemics in the Kimberley.  The median linear range for a wet area Kimberley camaenid is 20km, and 82 of the 93 camaenids were only collected in 1 to 5 patches.  Consequently, the rainforest communities of the Kimberley Region can be distinguished from similar rainforest communities elsewhere in northern Australia.",3,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Unknown,-,Kimberley workshop,4354,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets extent of occurrence criteria for CR) ",Minimum convex polygon of records in DPaW corporate database,Unknown,Kimberley workshop,141,"< 1,000ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR)",Sum of mapped polygons,Unknown,Kimberley workshop,< 5% area subject to pressures/threats,Static,Minor or negligible severity,Static,Expert opinion,Kimberley workshop,< 5% area subject to pressures/threats,Static,Minor or negligible severity,Static,Expert opinion,Kimberley workshop,wetland,,,None,Vulnerable,,"VN - B) restricted in AOO, EOO or number of occurrences, can be modified and is vulnerable to threatening processes ",NOK01,Unallocated crown land,1999,,Kimberley Rainforest Survey.,Pastoralism (specify),grazing pressure and trampling by unmanaged stock,Invasive/introduced omnivores (specify):,pigs,,,,,IN vi) Occurrences and boundaries of ecological communities,,EV iv) Develop/implement monitoring and evaluation and reporting plan ,,CP ii) Threatened/priority ecological community recovery plan (specify),recovery plan required,MD vi) Habitat restoration (specify),Fencing to exclude herbivores,MI viii) Biosecurity measures – post border (surveillance) (specify),surveillance for pigs,,,Keith Claymore: suggest the condition measures should be unknown if community not visited since 1999,,,,,

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of Big Springs organic mound springs,Big Springs,"Organic mound spring community of Big Springs, Dampierland.  A complex system of freshwater seepages and peaty springs with internal moats.  Situated on the eastern shore of King Sound, with broad tidal flats on the seaward margin and cracking clay flats on the landward margin. A further feature is the scattered clusters of small outlying, densely-vegetated mound springs. The main seepage area has an extensive outflow swamp on its north west side.  Within the complex, the substrate varies from peat through to peaty grey clay to grey clay.  The main seepage area supports well developed rainforest vegetation dominated by forests of Terminalia microcarpa, a species not otherwise known south of Walcott Inlet, 90 km to the north east.  Several mistletoe species (Loranthaceae) have been recorded in the Terminalia canopy, which reaches 20 m in places. Other trees present include cluster fig Ficus racemosa, banyan Ficus virens, the paperbark  Melaleuca ?leucadendra, Pandanus sp., dragon tree Sesbania formosa and Timonius timon.  Much less common species noted were Antidesma ghaesembilla, Diospyros maritima and Leichardt tree Nauclea orientalis. The understorey varies from central open glades with turf of Cyperaceae to pure leaf litter under the Terminalia canopies. Internal moats support the mangrove fern Acrostichum speciosum. Patches of duckweed Lemna aequinoctialis and, less commonly, hornwort Ceratophyllum demersum occur. One population of climbing swamp fern Stenochlaena palustris was noted. The outer perimeter of the large seepage feature is relatively dry in most places with this ring generally dominated by dense thickets of Melaleuca acacioides and/or Acacia ampliceps with scattered Bauhinia cunninghamii, chinese lantern Dichrostachys spicata and occasional boabs Adansonia gregorii of small stature. In the north west there is a perimeter swamp with extensive beds of narrowleaf cumbungi Typha domingensis and the sedge Schoenoplectus litoralis, with the occasional white-flowered black mangrove Lumnitzera racemosa. Outlying mound spring islands on tidal flats vary markedly in size and diversity of vegetation. Some of the smallest islands consist solely of Typha domingensis.

In areas where there is little or no vegetation and highly exposed shale, Ptilotus helichrysoides is often present.Leucopogon sp Port Gregory and Ozothamnus sp Northampton are two new species that were discovered as part of recent survey work are only known from this community. A third new Dodonaea species may also occur here but is subject to further studies. This community also contains the only accurate locality for Ptilotus chortophytum (P1) for over 30 years.This community is unique in that it occurs on exposed Kockatea Shale.  Kockatea Shale occurs to the west of the scarp from Carnarvon to Bunbury, however it is rarely exposed.  The vegetation that occurs on the exposed Kockatea Shale Formation is defined by Beard as Hutt 675 and is restricted to the Northampton area.

The vegetation of this landform is described by Beard as Shrublands; mixed thicket of Melaleuca and Hakea and is restricted to the Port Gregory/Northampton region. The community appears to be restricted by the geology and only occurs where the Kockatea shale is exposed at the surface, and occurs on both the upper and lower slopes.The vegetation of the lower slopes is often taller and denser than the rest of the community and is dominated by Melaleuca longistaminea, Melaleuca concreta and other Melaleuca species with occasional emergent Mallees. (Eucalyptus blaxellii, (VU) and another mallee)  The mid slope is dominated by Melaleuca longistaminea and in some areas Gastrolobium propinquum (P1) and Leucopogon sp Port Gregory are also frequent on the mid slopes.  In areas where there is little or no vegetation and highly exposed shale, Ptilotus helichrysoides is often present.Leucopogon sp Port Gregory and Ozothamnus sp Northampton are two new species that were discovered as part of recent survey work are only known from this community. A third new Dodonaea species may also occur here but is subject to further studies. This community also contains the only accurate locality for Ptilotus chortophytum (P1) for over 30 years.This community is unique in that it occurs on exposed Kockatea Shale.  Kockatea Shale occurs to the west of the scarp from Carnarvon to Bunbury, however it is rarely exposed.  The vegetation that occurs on the exposed Kockatea Shale Formation is defined by Beard as Hutt 675 and is restricted to the Northampton area. Therefore if Kockatea Shale was to be exposed at the surface in other areas it would be unlikely that the vegetation would be similar. (Mathew Cobb, Geologist, Pers Comm.

Western Australia,Wheatbelt,Eucalypt woodlands of the Western Australian Wheatbelt,Wheatbelt Woodlands,"This community includes all eucalypt-dominated woodlands in the Western Australian Wheatbelt region as defined by the Avon Wheatbelt 1 and 2 and Western Mallee subregions within the Interim Biogeographic Regionalisation of Australia (IBRA 6.1, Commonwealth of Australia, 2005) with the specific exceptions of: 
 
• Woodlands and forests dominated or co-dominated by Jarrah (E. marginata) and Marri (Corymbia calophylla) where they occur without York Gum present 
• Woodlands dominated or co-dominated by E. wandoo where it occurs in jarrah forest (but is included for Wheatbelt)
• Non-woodland communities dominated by eucalypts, specifically those dominated by eucalypts with a mallee growth form. 

The Wheatbelt eucalypt woodlands include a diversity of sub-communities in which the eucalypt species occur in association with other species characteristic of this region, such that together these species constitute a distinct ecological sub-community.  Both mallee and woodland forms of the key eucalypt species occur in association with either shrub or other understorey.  However, this community specifically focuses on woodland eucalypt sub-communities.  Although mallee eucalypts may be present, they are included only where they occur in the understorey.   
 
The community is intentionally broad in the diversity of sub-communities included because of the rich diversity and complexity of such communities, occurring in a fine-scale mosaic influenced by climate, topography, soils and hydrology, as well as land use.  
 
Among these communities, those dominated by Salmon Gum (Eucalyptus salmonophloia), York Gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba), Red Morrel (Eucalyptus longicornis) and Gimlet (Eucalyptus salubris) capture the most heavily cleared and at risk of the wheatbelt eucalypt woodlands.  Other eucalypt woodlands have also been extensively cleared (e.g. Wandoo (Eucalyptus wandoo), Wheatbelt Wandoo (Eucalyptus capillosa) and Powderbark Wandoo (Eucalyptus accedens) or occur only in small isolated patches (e.g. Mallets such as Eucalyptus singularis, Salt Gum (Eucalyptus salicola) and Yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis).",1000+,Greater than 20 (does not meet IUCN location criteria),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Loss of occurrences (pressures > recovery actions),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Wheatbelt Region: loss due to degradation and/or clearing.

Western Australia,Midwest,Lake MacLeod invertebrate Assemblages,Lake MacLeod,"Saline aquatic community with strong marine affinities with particularly rich copepod elements - is effectively a well developed, very rich birrida community with strong marine and terrestrial components with especially rich hypactacoid community. Distinctive but lacks threats. Lake MacLeod received marine groundwater, which upwells 20km inland in sinkholes on the western side of the lake, as well as surface inflow via the Minilya River, smaller creeks and sheet flow from the Gascoyne River after very heavy rain. It has been shown to support very high numbers of waterbirds, especially migratory shorebirds as well as containing some of the few inland stands of mangroves in Western Australia. Lake MacLeod was open to the sea during the Last Interglacial, and is an example of a very large birrida. Lake MacLeod has an area of 150,000ha when fully flooded. (Halse et. al., 2000) Blue Holes area seems unique (Winston Kay pers. comm.) Invertebrates show it very clearly to be a community of its own (S. Halse pers. comm).                                                                                                                                    Lake MacLeod includes distinct “inner wetlands” (sinkholes, channels, lakes, marshes) in the west and “floodout marshes” at river mouths in the north-east as well as a lake bed that is frequently inundated. Several macroscale islands lie in the east and north of the lake bed. The lake is situated in the Carnarvon Basin, in calcareous marine deposits. It is a former sea embayment that was separated from the sea at the south by development of sand dunes. Water from the ocean passes underground 18km through coastal limestone and under hydrostatic pressure rises up in sinkholes in the central west part of the lake bed. Sinkholes are several metres deep however the rest of the lake fluctuates from 0 to 1.5m deep. The lake is one of the most important non-tidal stop-over sites in Australia for migratory shorebirds. It also supports Australia’s largest inland community of mangroves and associated fauna. Plant structural formations include Low closed-forest to open-scrub/shrubland (mangroves). The mangrove community is the largest of only two inland occurrences in WA; the other is at Mandora Salt Marshes. The highest number of waterbirds counted was 114 956 in September 1987. A fish known as Amniataba caudavittatus – Yellow Trumpeter is known to occur in the sinkholes. The lake supports a major commercial saltfield; brine is obtained from the lake bed. Lake MacLeod (vacant crown land) is covered by a mining lease (Dampier Salt Co.) The site is included on the Register of the National Estate.

Western Australia,South Coast,Swamp Yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis) woodland in seasonally-inundated basins (South Coast),Swamp Yate woodland (South Coast),"This vegetation unit occurred frequently on the valley floor of the survey area as small, more-or-less
circular basins filled with clay that were inundated from winter until mid summer or longer (Figure 4.2).
The centre of these sumplands was usually inhabited by Swamp Yate (Eucalyptus occidentalis) low
woodland (Table 4.7, Plate 4.6) often with an understorey of the Saltwater Paperbark (Melaleuca
cuticularis). Peripheral to the central seasonally-inundated basin of these wetlands there was often a
waterlogged zone of E. occidentalis associated with Kunzea recurva heath to open scrub and/or the small
trees Melaleuca preissiana and Banksia littoralis and a number of mallees (primarily Eucalyptus
decipiens subsp. adesmophloia). Fringing the wetland there was usually an Anarthria laevis sedgeland.
However in the wetlands where there was shallow laterite, the sedgeland was usually replaced with a
Pericalymma ellipticum heath. The Swamp Yate was not present in Site 16; however the vegetation and
floristics of this wetland were otherwise very similar to that of the Swamp Yate sites.
The understorey shrubs of this vegetation were typically very open. Melaleuca cuticularis, Kunzea
recurva and Hakea nitida generally formed an open tall shrub layer. Hakea denticulata, Hakea laurina,
Hakea varia, Exocarpos sparteus, Agonis theiformis, Lambertia inermis and Nuytsia floribunda were also
sometimes present in the seasonally waterlogged areas fringing the sumplands. Other common shrub
taxa, recorded at low density across the sampled sites were Isopogon trilobus, Acacia pulchella var.
glaberrima, Taxandria spathulata, Astartea glomerosa, Astartea aspera, Beaufortia empetrifolia,
Melaleuca concinna and Conothamnus aureus. Other mid and low shrub species recorded at lower
abundance included Acacia biflora, Acacia luteola, A. subcaerulea, Adenanthos cuneatus, Banksia
baueri, Banksia dryandroides, Bossiaea praetermissa, Daviesia inflata, Dryandra falcata, Dryandra
mucronulata subsp. mucronulata, Dryandra tenuifolia var. tenuifolia, Gompholobium confertum,
Hibbertia lineata, Leucopogon conostephioides, Melaleuca subtrigona, Petrophile squamata subsp.
squamata, Petrophile media, Spyridium majoranifolium, Stirlingia anethifolia and Thomasia stelligera.
The perennial herbs Villarsia parnassifolia, Anthotium humile, Stylidium corymbosum, Goodenia
filiformis and Velleia trinervis were abundant in the wetlands in good condition. These herbs inhabited
the shallowly-inundated zone of the wetland and were most apparent when the water receded and the
herbs were in flower in late summer.
A dense ground layer was generally present in the seasonally waterlogged fringe of the sumplands and
this was dominated by rushes and sedges including Anarthria laevis, Baumea juncea, Gahnia
ancistrophylla, Lepidosperma striatum, Schoenus laevigatus, Schoenus subfascicularis and Tricostularia
compressa. A suite of native grasses was also recorded including Amphipogon amphipogonoides,
Austrostipa hemipogon, Cyperochloa hirsuta, Deyeuxia quadriseta and Neurachne alopecuroidea.
Naturalised alien grasses and herbs were prevalent in the more disturbed wetlands and these included
*Aira caryophyllea, *Cirsium vulgare, *Conyza parva, *Conyza sumatrensis, *Hordeum leporinum,
*Hypochaeris glabra, Juncus pallidus,*Lagurus ovatus, *Pennisetum clandestinum, *Pseudognaphalium
luteoalbum, *Rumex crispus, *Solanum nigrum and *Vulpia myuros var. megalura.
The mean species richness of these sites was 23.5 taxa per 10 m x 10 m quadrat, with a total of 166 taxa
recorded within the assemblage (including 24 naturalised alien taxa). One rare species, Commersonia sp.

Reedia spathacea is a major structural and possibly functional component of these wetlands and an indicator of specific wetland habitat (hydroperiod, water chemistry), vegetation floristics and condition. It is sensitive to severe or frequent fire and is preferentially grazed by feral pigs until virtual elimination from a site. These assemblages inhabit sandy mud floodplains and paluslopes of peat over mud of leptoscale river and creek tributaries of the Blackwood River which have perennially high water tables and only occur between Alexandra Bridge and Sues Rd on the Blackwood Plateau. The freshwater wetlands are unusual in this climatic region in that their high water tables are primarily maintained by artesian flow from the deep regional Leederville/Yaragadee aquifers.",6,Refer to State level,Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,"South West workshop: TEC has been mapped on presence of Reedia, there are other wetlands that are this type but not Reedia",Refer to State level,N/A,,Expanding (new knowledge - biological survey),South West workshop.

These communities are not fixed in space or time but exist in a state of dynamic equilibrium. They are dependent on a cycle of regeneration of host species adjacent to an existing site occupied by the community, these then persisting long enough for the community to migrate by spore or vegetative propagules onto the new hosts, this commencing at about ages 12-15 years. Some community members appear to have better dispersal mechanisms occurring more frequenetly in them than others while some are restricted and infrequent. These communiites occur in typically long unburnt pockets in the forest, usually in situations where high soil moisture and local high atmospheric humidity persists for most of the year. Natural fire incursions into these sites appear infrequent and provide the natural mosaic within them required for the community to persist.

Western Australia,Swan,"Brackish microbial community number 1 (Government House, Rottnest)",Government House Lake Microbial,"About 10% of Rottnest Island is occupied by salt lakes, the deepest of which, Government House Lake, is up to 8.5m deep. The lakes have elongate-ovoid to sub-circular shapes, and are believed to overlie dolines formed by rainwater solution of the limestone and subsequent collapse of cave systems during Pleistocene periods of lower sea-level. The dolines were subsequently largely filled by Holocene sediments, and as sand dunes accumulated over the old karst surface. 

Water levels in the lakes rise to about mean sea-level in winter and fall more than a metre in summer as a result of evaporation. The larger lakes (including Government House Lake) commonly have late-summer salinities exceeding 150 000 mg/L. It is interesting that such high salinities can be maintained in the lakes when they are separated from the ocean by only narrow strips of porous limestone or sand. The explanation for this isolation of the hypersaline lake waters is believed to be the presence of impervious algal layers on the lake floors, which together with the muddy bottom sediments effectively seal the lakes. 

The three deeper lakes (including Government House Lake) become meramictic (“hot lakes”) during winter and spring, the bottom waters being up to 10°C warmer than the surface waters (Bunn and Edwards, 1984). The stratification of the water body that causes meromixis is due to fresh water from springs and rainfall spreading over the surface, above the heavier hypersaline lake water. This stratification is destroyed by evaporation and wind action during summer and autumn.

Modern salt lake deposits, consisting of algal, cyanobacterial, and evaporitic sediments, form veneers on the floors of the salt lakes and around their margins, overlying the Herschell and Tamala Limestones.

Hassell and Kneebone (1960) describe algal gyttja in the lake deposits. This consists largely of gel-like material from the green alga Botrycoccus (Hodgkin, 1959) mixed with gypsum and lime mud. Edward (1983) records benthic microbial mats up to 10cm thick on floors of the lakes, constructed by Botrycoccus and the cyanobacteria Aphanothecae halophytica, Oscillatoria sp., and Spirulina sp, together with the diatom Navicula sp. These mats from living stromatolites in a few areas, notably beside the old bathing groyne on the north side of Government House Lake.

Stromatolites occur on the shallow shelf immediately east of the groyne at depths (relative to summer water levels) of about 0.2m to 3m. Nodular branching columns and smooth undulous forms occur. Most are only about 5-10cm high, but some are as much as 20cm high. The stromatolites become progressively sparser in deeper water, and do not extend beyond depths of about 3m. Some grew on water-logged tree branches and other debris. Bubbles of oxygen, resulting from photosynthetic activity can be seen on the living microbial mats, which are greenish to yellow-grey and black in colour. 

From the thickness of stromatolites growing on old soft-drink bottles (brands that were current in the 1920s and 1930s when bathing in the hypersaline water was still fashionable) it is deduced that the stromatolites grow at rates of as much at 1.5mm per year.

SWA02,Swan,Microbialites and microbial mats of coastal hypersaline lakes (Rottnest Island); Lake Baghdad ,Rottnest Island microbial - Baghdad,"About 10% of Rottnest Island is occupied by salt lakes, the deepest of which, Government House Lake, is up to 8.5m deep. The lakes have elongate-ovoid to sub-circular shapes, and are believed to overlie dolines formed by rainwater solution of the limestone and subsequent collapse of cave systems during Pleistocene periods of lower sea-level. The dolines were subsequently largely filled by Holocene sediments, and as sand dunes accumulated over the old karst surface. 

Water levels in the lakes rise to about mean sea-level in winter and fall more than a metre in summer as a result of evaporation. The larger lakes (including Government House Lake) commonly have late-summer salinities exceeding 150 000 mg/L. It is interesting that such high salinities can be maintained in the lakes when they are separated from the ocean by only narrow strips of porous limestone or sand. The explanation for this isolation of the hypersaline lake waters is believed to be the presence of impervious algal layers on the lake floors, which together with the muddy bottom sediments effectively seal the lakes. 

The three deeper lakes (including Government House Lake) become meramictic (“hot lakes”) during winter and spring, the bottom waters being up to 10°C warmer than the surface waters (Bunn and Edwards, 1984). The stratification of the water body that causes meromixis is due to fresh water from springs and rainfall spreading over the surface, above the heavier hypersaline lake water. This stratification is destroyed by evaporation and wind action during summer and autumn.

Modern salt lake deposits, consisting of algal, cyanobacterial, and evaporitic sediments, form veneers on the floors of the salt lakes and around their margins, overlying the Herschell and Tamala Limestones.

Hassell and Kneebone (1960) describe algal gyttja in the lake deposits. This consists largely of gel-like material from the green alga Botrycoccus (Hodgkin, 1959) mixed with gypsum and lime mud. Edward (1983) records benthic microbial mats up to 10cm thick on floors of the lakes, constructed by Botrycoccus and the cyanobacteria Aphanothecae halophytica, Oscillatoria sp., and Spirulina sp, together with the diatom Navicula sp. These mats from living stromatolites in a few areas, notably beside the old bathing groyne on the north side of Government House Lake.

Stromatolites occur on the shallow shelf immediately east of the groyne at depths (relative to summer water levels) of about 0.2m to 3m. Nodular branching columns and smooth undulous forms occur. Most are only about 5-10cm high, but some are as much as 20cm high. The stromatolites become progressively sparser in deeper water, and do not extend beyond depths of about 3m. Some grew on water-logged tree branches and other debris. Bubbles of oxygen, resulting from photosynthetic activity can be seen on the living microbial mats, which are greenish to yellow-grey and black in colour.

SWA02,Swan,"Microbialites and microbial mats of coastal hypersaline lakes (Rottnest Island); Serpentine, Lake",Rottnest Island microbial - Serpentine,"About 10% of Rottnest Island is occupied by salt lakes, the deepest of which, Government House Lake, is up to 8.5m deep. The lakes have elongate-ovoid to sub-circular shapes, and are believed to overlie dolines formed by rainwater solution of the limestone and subsequent collapse of cave systems during Pleistocene periods of lower sea-level. The dolines were subsequently largely filled by Holocene sediments, and as sand dunes accumulated over the old karst surface. 

Water levels in the lakes rise to about mean sea-level in winter and fall more than a metre in summer as a result of evaporation. The larger lakes (including Government House Lake) commonly have late-summer salinities exceeding 150 000 mg/L. It is interesting that such high salinities can be maintained in the lakes when they are separated from the ocean by only narrow strips of porous limestone or sand. The explanation for this isolation of the hypersaline lake waters is believed to be the presence of impervious algal layers on the lake floors, which together with the muddy bottom sediments effectively seal the lakes. 

The three deeper lakes (including Government House Lake) become meramictic (“hot lakes”) during winter and spring, the bottom waters being up to 10°C warmer than the surface waters (Bunn and Edwards, 1984). The stratification of the water body that causes meromixis is due to fresh water from springs and rainfall spreading over the surface, above the heavier hypersaline lake water. This stratification is destroyed by evaporation and wind action during summer and autumn.

Modern salt lake deposits, consisting of algal, cyanobacterial, and evaporitic sediments, form veneers on the floors of the salt lakes and around their margins, overlying the Herschell and Tamala Limestones.

Hassell and Kneebone (1960) describe algal gyttja in the lake deposits. This consists largely of gel-like material from the green alga Botrycoccus (Hodgkin, 1959) mixed with gypsum and lime mud. Edward (1983) records benthic microbial mats up to 10cm thick on floors of the lakes, constructed by Botrycoccus and the cyanobacteria Aphanothecae halophytica, Oscillatoria sp., and Spirulina sp, together with the diatom Navicula sp. These mats from living stromatolites in a few areas, notably beside the old bathing groyne on the north side of Government House Lake.

Stromatolites occur on the shallow shelf immediately east of the groyne at depths (relative to summer water levels) of about 0.2m to 3m. Nodular branching columns and smooth undulous forms occur. Most are only about 5-10cm high, but some are as much as 20cm high. The stromatolites become progressively sparser in deeper water, and do not extend beyond depths of about 3m. Some grew on water-logged tree branches and other debris. Bubbles of oxygen, resulting from photosynthetic activity can be seen on the living microbial mats, which are greenish to yellow-grey and black in colour. 

From the thickness of stromatolites growing on old soft-drink bottles (brands that were current in the 1920s and 1930s when bathing in the hypersaline water was still fashionable) it is deduced that the stromatolites grow at rates of as much at 1.5mm per year.

Hassell and Kneebone (1960) describe algal gyttja in the lake deposits. This consists largely of gel-like material from the green alga Botrycoccus (Hodgkin, 1959) mixed with gypsum and lime mud. Edward (1983) records benthic microbial mats up to 10cm thick on floors of the lakes, constructed by Botrycoccus and the cyanobacteria Aphanothecae halophytica, Oscillatoria sp., and Spirulina sp, together with the diatom Navicula sp. These mats from living stromatolites in a few areas, notably beside the old bathing groyne on the north side of Government House Lake.

Stromatolites occur on the shallow shelf immediately east of the groyne at depths (relative to summer water levels) of about 0.2m to 3m. Nodular branching columns and smooth undulous forms occur. Most are only about 5-10cm high, but some are as much as 20cm high. The stromatolites become progressively sparser in deeper water, and do not extend beyond depths of about 3m. Some grew on water-logged tree branches and other debris. Bubbles of oxygen, resulting from photosynthetic activity can be seen on the living microbial mats, which are greenish to yellow-grey and black in colour. 

From the thickness of stromatolites growing on old soft-drink bottles (brands that were current in the 1920s and 1930s when bathing in the hypersaline water was still fashionable) it is deduced that the stromatolites grow at rates of as much at 1.5mm per year.

From Playford et al 1988.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          From John et al (2009): The lake system has extensive benthic microbial communities (BMC) in the form of algal mats dominated in biomass by cyanobacteria. The BMC in Rottnest Island’s salt lakes have higher diversity and biomass of cyanobacteria than diatoms. Species of Aphanothece, Oscillatoria, Microcoleus, Spirulina, Schizothrix and Gloeocapsa are the common cyanobacteria in the BMC of Rottnest Island salt lakes.",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,S&C: not known in 2002,N/A,N/A,,,,8,< 10ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR),Sum of mapped polygons,Expanding (new knowledge - biological survey),S&C: survey since 2002,< 5% area subject to pressures/threats,Unknown,Minor or negligible severity,Unknown,-,S&C: trends unknown,< 5% area subject to pressures/threats,Unknown,Minor or negligible severity,Unknown,-,S&C: trends unknown,microbial,,,None,Priority 1,2011,"P1 - generally ? 5 occurrences or AOO ? 100 ha, occurrences under threat ",SWA02,Other crown reserves,2013,,"S&C workshop: past pressues, future threats, management requirements",no known past pressures,,Recreational disturbance (specify):,tourism,none,,,,HD i) Develop hydrological model to forecast effect on biodiversity under different water use allocations,,EV i) Develop/implement ecological monitoring protocols (condition or state of asset),,CP ix) Other management plan (specify),better articulation of biological values of microbial assemblages in the Rottnest Island management plan,,,MI xi) Regulation - environmental impact assessment,,MI xiii) Education and awareness (specify),interpretation signage,,,,,,

Western Australia,Pilbara,Cape Range Remipede Community,Bundera,"An anchialine habitat with a rich troglobitic fauna composed primarily of crustaceans, but including two blind fishes (Humphreys and Adams 1991; Poore and Humphreys 1992; Bruce and Humphreys 1993; Humphreys 1993a). The faunal composition consists of the same groups of crustaceans recorded from anchialine caves of the Bahamas, the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and Cuba (Yager 1987a, 1987b, 1994). They include cirolanid isopods, atyid shrimp, ostracodes, gammarid amphipods, remipedes and thermosbaenaceans. 
This aquatic community composition has become predictable in anchialine habitats on either side of the North Atlantic (Holsinger 1989, 1992; Yager 1994), and the occurrence of additional relict taxa in northwestern Australia was predicted (Humphreys 1993a) owing to the presence of thermosbaenaceans (Poore and Humphreys 1992) and cirolanids (Humphreys 1993a).

The remipede community  is known only from Bundera Sinkhole (C-28), an anchialine cave on the western side of the Cape Range peninsula where it occurs below a pycnocline and comprises an assemblage of native species endemic to northwestern Australia, several known only from this site while others are more widespread on the fringes of the North West Shelf. It contains a number of species unique to that site and others unique to the fringes of the North West Shelf.  These include:-
Lasionectes exleyi Yager and Humphreys  (Remipedia)
Liagoceradocus branchialis  Bradbury and Williams (Crustacea: Hadziida)
Danielopolina undescribed species (Baltanas et al.,  in prep)(Ostracoda: Halocyprida: Thaumatocyprididae)

CAR01,Pilbara,Cape Range Remipede Community,Bundera,"An anchialine habitat with a rich troglobitic fauna composed primarily of crustaceans, but including two blind fishes (Humphreys and Adams 1991; Poore and Humphreys 1992; Bruce and Humphreys 1993; Humphreys 1993a). The faunal composition consists of the same groups of crustaceans recorded from anchialine caves of the Bahamas, the Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico, and Cuba (Yager 1987a, 1987b, 1994). They include cirolanid isopods, atyid shrimp, ostracodes, gammarid amphipods, remipedes and thermosbaenaceans. 
This aquatic community composition has become predictable in anchialine habitats on either side of the North Atlantic (Holsinger 1989, 1992; Yager 1994), and the occurrence of additional relict taxa in northwestern Australia was predicted (Humphreys 1993a) owing to the presence of thermosbaenaceans (Poore and Humphreys 1992) and cirolanids (Humphreys 1993a).

The remipede community  is known only from Bundera Sinkhole (C-28), an anchialine cave on the western side of the Cape Range peninsula where it occurs below a pycnocline and comprises an assemblage of native species endemic to northwestern Australia, several known only from this site while others are more widespread on the fringes of the North West Shelf. It contains a number of species unique to that site and others unique to the fringes of the North West Shelf.  These include:-

Western Australia,Pilbara,Camerons Cave Troglobitic Community,Camerons,"A troblobitic (obligatory cave inhabitants) community inhabiting the coastal plain of the Cape Range peninsula. The community is known only from Camerons Cave (C-452)  in the Exmouth townsite.

The species assemblage is related to that found in caves in Cape Range sensu stricto (papers in Humphreys, 1993), but is quite distinct from it.  Most of the troglobitic species found there  are known from nowhere else.   These include:-

• Stygiochiropus peculiaris Shear and Humphreys (Diplopoda: Polydesmida: Paradoxosomatidae Australiosomatinae: Antichiropodini):
only known from six specimens (2 collected dead) from C-452. Three other species of the genus, which is endemic to Cape Range (Humphreys and Shear,  1993; Shear and Humphreys, 1996), occur in Cape Range sensu stricto.

• Hyella sp. nov. (Pseudoscorpionida: Hyidae): only known from the dark zone of C-452 from 4 female and one adult male specimens plus 5 immature. Specimens BES 2545;  2546;  2554; 4249;  4148; 4149;  4154;  1154;  2525. Another species of the genus, which is endemic to Cape Range (Harvey, 1993) occurs in Cape Range sensu stricto.

• An undescribed species of troglomorphic  harvestmen (Opilionida: Assamiidae)— specimens BES 2549; 4189.

• An undescribed species of troglomorphic  harvestmen (Opilionida: Phalangodidae) is only known specimen of the family Phalangodidae from Cape Range— specimen BES 2543. 

• An undescribed troglomorphic species of cave spider (Hahniidae: Araneae), known from one specimen —BES 1155. A related troglomorphic species is known from caves in Cape Range proper.

• Phaconura sp. nov. (Hemiptera: Meenoplidae), troglomorphic (H. Hoch, pers. comm.), very different from all other Phaconeura—BES 2544 . Know only from C-452.  Another species of Phaconeura occurs in caves in Cape Range proper (Hoch, 1993).

• An undescribed troglomorphic species of cave spider (Ctenidae: Araneae) known from three specimen, all juvenile —BES 2526; 2539; 2541. Related epigean and troglobitic species are known from Cape Range proper (Harvey et al. 1993).

• Draculoides bramstokeri Harvey and Humphreys (Schizomida: Hubbardiidae) is troglobitic and occurs in the cave.  This species is known from one other location in Exmouth and from Barrow Island (Harvey and Humphreys 1995).  Several other species of Schizomida are known from Cape Range caves both from the coastal plain and the range proper, mostly troglomorphic (Harvey et al. 1993; M.S. Harvey, pers. comm.).

• Trichocyclus sp. (Pholcidae: Araneae).  Species presently uncertain; known from three specimens —BES 2021; 4248.


To date all species with congeneric members in caves in Cape Range proper have proved to be quite distinct species. This cave community is recognisable by its unique composition of species of which at least • are known only from this location.

Western Australia,Pilbara,Subterranean invertebrate community of pisolitic hills in the Pilbara,Robe Valley Pisolitic Hills,"A series of low undulating hills (Mesa H, Todd Bore and Warramboo) occurring in the Robe Valley near Pannawonica in the Shire of Ashburton in the State's Pilbara Region.  The hills are remnants of old valley infill deposits of the palaeo Robe River. Pisolite is made up of spherical accretions of iron minerals called pisoliths (the iron ore source), which often have small caverns and spaces between them. These interstices can be large enough to accommodate troglobitic fauna (Biota 2006C). Troglobitic faunal communities occurs in extremely specialised habitats and appear to require the particular structure and hydrogeology associated with mesas (but also apparently with other ironstone hills in the Robe Valley Region - Biota 2006A) to provide a suitable humid habitat (EPA 2007). Specifically, the habitat is the humidified pisolitic strata (small round accretionary masses of rock).

Western Australia,Southwest,Aquatic Root Mat Community Number 1 of Caves of the Leeuwin Naturaliste Ridge,CAVES LEEUWIN01,"The four originally described root mat communities occur separately in Easter and Jewel Caves (this TEC), Strongs Cave, Calgardup Cave, and Kudjal Yolgah and Budjur Mar Caves on the Leeuwin-Naturaliste Ridge. Species composition of the community in each of these cave systems differs significantly. Each community is described as comprising a complete food web; the rootlets and their associated microflora providing the primary food source, and root mat grazers, predators, parasites, detritivores, and scavengers completing the interactions. The root mats are produced by karri (Eucalyptus diversicolor) in Easter Cave. Aquatic cavernicoles (cave animals) in these communities include koonacs (Cherax preissii), other crustaceans, mites, rotifers, microscopic worms, tardigrades, and insects and crustaceans. Some of the species appear to be endemic to these cave systems, and some to be confined to a single cave.Easter and Jewel Caves are both Augusta watertable caves and part of the Jewel Cave karst system (sensu Eberhard 2004) and linked hydrologically. The two caves are therefore mapped as one occurrence of the TEC. The fauna of these two caves share three species, all of which are endemic to this karst system. Thus, the new root mat assemblages found in these caves are clearly new areas of the known root mat community number 1. 

A possible additional occurrence of root mat community no. 1 may have occurred in Labyrinth Cave, a different sub-system, but which Eberhard (2004) defines as also part of the Jewel Cave karst system.

Western Australia,Goldfields,Lee Steere Range vegetation complexes (banded ironstone formation),Lee Steere Range,"All the vegetation units associated with the BIF and BIF outwash geology of the Lee Steere Range. Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Thompson and Sheehy (2009): Community type 1 is generally located on the mid-slopes of BIF with gentle to moderate gradients, recorded from four localities. Community structure is tall open Acacia shrubland, particularly Acacia quadrimarginea, over sparse to open mid-stratum of Eremophila margarethae and Senna glaucifolia shrubs with open hummock grasslands of Triodia melvillei. Indicator species analyses suggests that Acacia quadrimarginea, Acacia rhodophloia, Eremophila margarethae, Keraudrenia velutina subsp. elliptica, Senna glaucifolia, Stenanthemum petraeum and Triodia melvillei are typical taxa for this community. Coarse fragments, primarily weathered banded ironstone, were a significant component of the bareground with some presence of exposed bedrock of weathered ironstone. Soils were strongly acidic (pH 3.9-4.1) sandy loams.

Community type 2 is a group of four sites with a high cover of coarse weathered ironstone fragments over strongly acidic (pH 4.1-4.6) sandy loams found from the mid-slopes to the crests. The unifying characteristics of this community are the open shrubland of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa over Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei with sparse cover of Ptilotus obovatus, P. schwartzii and Tribulus suberosus. Typical species were tall shrubs of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa, mid-stratum of Dodonaea petiolaris, Ptilotus obovatus and Senna glutinosa subsp. x luerssenii and a lower stratum of Ptilotus schwartzii, Sida sp. Excedentifolia (J.L. Egan 1925) and Sida sp. golden calyces glabrous (H.N. Foote 32), Solanum ellipticum, and Tribulus suberosus.  Typical coarse fragments are composed of weathered iron

Community type 3 is the most wide spread of all the floristic communities occurring on the crests and upper slopes of ironstone formations, recorded at 16 locations. This community type is composed of sparse talls shrubs of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa and A. citrinoviridis over isolated to sparse shrubland of Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, E. margarethae with isolated Ptilotus schwartzii. Typical taxa in this community were A. citrinoviridis, Baeckea sp. Melita Station (H. Pringle 2738), E. granitica and Cheilanthes brownii.  Coarse fragments were principally weathered laminar and granular ironstone, hematite, quartz and associated metasediments. Exposed bedrock of laminar and granular iron-enriched rock was present across the community, varying from very slightly rocky (<2%) to very rocky (20-50%). The underlying soils were strongly acidic (pH 3.9-4.0) sandy loams.

Community type 4 is primarily located on the mid- to lower-slopes and pediments, with occasionally found further upslope, recorded at 14 sites on the range. Community structure is tall sparse to open shrublands of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa with sparse mid-stratum of Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei over isolated hummock grassland of Triodia melvillei and isolated grasses of Eragrostis eriopoda complex. Indicator values identified Acacia aneura var. microcarpa, Eragrostis eriopoda complex and Eriachne mucronata as typical taxa for this community.  Coarse fragments were typically weathered laminar ironstones, hematite, quartz and associated metasediments varying from common to very abundant. Soils were highly acidic (pH 4-4.9) sandy loams to sandy clay loams. Exposed bedrock,
principally weathered laminar and granular ironstone, was minimal across the sites, typically <2%.

Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Thompson and Sheehy (2009): Community type 1 is generally located on the mid-slopes of BIF with gentle to moderate gradients, recorded from four localities. Community structure is tall open Acacia shrubland, particularly Acacia quadrimarginea, over sparse to open mid-stratum of Eremophila margarethae and Senna glaucifolia shrubs with open hummock grasslands of Triodia melvillei. Indicator species analyses suggests that Acacia quadrimarginea, Acacia rhodophloia, Eremophila margarethae, Keraudrenia velutina subsp. elliptica, Senna glaucifolia, Stenanthemum petraeum and Triodia melvillei are typical taxa for this community. Coarse fragments, primarily weathered banded ironstone, were a significant component of the bareground with some presence of exposed bedrock of weathered ironstone. Soils were strongly acidic (pH 3.9-4.1) sandy loams.

Community type 2 is a group of four sites with a high cover of coarse weathered ironstone fragments over strongly acidic (pH 4.1-4.6) sandy loams found from the mid-slopes to the crests. The unifying characteristics of this community are the open shrubland of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa over Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei with sparse cover of Ptilotus obovatus, P. schwartzii and Tribulus suberosus. Typical species were tall shrubs of Acacia aneura var. microcarpa, mid-stratum of Dodonaea petiolaris, Ptilotus obovatus and Senna glutinosa subsp. x luerssenii and a lower stratum of Ptilotus schwartzii, Sida sp. Excedentifolia (J.L. Egan 1925) and Sida sp. golden calyces glabrous (H.N. Foote 32), Solanum ellipticum, and Tribulus suberosus.  Typical coarse fragments are composed of weathered iron

Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Markey and Dillon (2010):                                             Community type 1 is a grouping of sites on rocky hill slopes and crests of ridges of banded iron formation.  Community type 1a is structurally heterogenous unit on gentle to moderately steep hill slopes and crests. Typically this floristic community consists of tall open - sparse Acacia aneura shrubland where Acacia aneura var cf. microcarpa is a significant indicator species, and often with additional Acacia species such as A. quadrimarginea or A. thoma. The sparse mid-stratum consists of various shrubs, including significant indicator species Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, Solanum ashbyae and Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit. Other common taxa include Ptilotus schwartzii and the perennial grasses Cymbopogon ambiguus and Eriachne helmsii, the latter of which is a significant indicator species. Notable taxa include Prostanthera campbellii, Eriachne helmsii and Psydrax suaveolens on rocky crests, Homalocalyx echinulatus and Eremophila jucunda subsp. jucunda, which form low shrublands on shallow colluviums over sheets of bedrock on mid – lower slopes, and Senna artemisioides subsp. helmsii and Eremophila forrestii, which are also found on mid – lower slopes.  More sampling may provide enough floristic information to further subdivide Community type 1a into a upper slope - crest community and a low crests and lower slope community. Community type 1b is marginally more species rich than Community type 1a. Found on gently – moderately inclined mid-upper hill slopes and crests of weathered BIF, this community consists of a more structurally homogenous community than Community type 1a. This community consists of Acacia aneura var cf. microcarpa and Thryptomene decussata tall open - sparse shrubland, with Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa as a occasional co-dominant, Common and distinctive mid- stratum shrubs include Eremophila latrobei subsp latrobei, Solanum ashbyae, Eremophila georgii, Dodonaea petiolaris, Dodonaea rigida, Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit, Ptilotusobovatus, Cheilanthes sieberi, Ptilotus schwartzii, and, less frequently, Scaevola spinescens. The perennial grass Thyridolepis multiculmis is noted as a significant indicator species for the ground layer. 
Community type 2 is the characteristic community type of the steeper, rocky crests and upper slopes of BIF. The majority of sites were located in the southern half of the range, where there are taller and more substantial outcroppings of BIF. It is described as sparse shrublands of Acacia aneura and Thryptomene decussata over midstratum shrubs of Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, Prostanthera campbellii, Philotheca brucei subsp. brucei, Eremophila georgei, Olearia humilis, Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit (H.N. Foote 32) and Dodonaea petiolaris, over a ground layer that includes Cheilanthes brownii and perennial grasses such as Eragrostis lacunaria. One site of this community consisted of a woodland of Callitris columellaris on very steep escarpment near the crest of the range.                                                                                                                            Community type 3 is closely allied to Community type 4. Sites grouped in this community type are typically shrublands on lower slopes, pediments, valley flats or plains adjacent to BIF landforms. These are shrublands of Acacia aneura (var. cf. microcarpa.and var. cf. tenuis), often with Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa as co-dominant, over a shrub stratum over Senna spp. (particularly Senna glaucifolia), Eremophila jucunda subsp. jucunda, Solanum lasiophyllum, Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, Eremophila galeata, Ptilotus obovatus and Ptilotus schwartzii. Most of these listed taxa are significant indicator species for this community, and other taxa have relatively high indicator values. This is a comparatively more speciose community, with an average number of total taxa of 31.1 ± 2.5 (s.e.) per quadrat. 
Community type 4 is the community typical of pediments and valley flats at the base of the Booylgoo Range, which consists typically of tall, sparse – open shrublands of Acacia aneura, Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa and Acacia craspedocarpa, with isolated trees of Brachychiton gregorii, over a sparse or open shrubland of Solanum lasiophyllum, Senna glaucifolia, Senna sp. Meekatharra (E. Bailey 1–26), Senna artemisioides subsp. helmsii, Eremophila galeata and Ptilotus obovatus, over perennial grasses such as Enneapogon caerulescens and Monachather paradoxa. The main indicator species are Brachychiton gregorii, Senna glaucifolia, Acacia craspedocarpa, Eremophila galeata, and the hybrid, Senna artemisioides subsp. helmsii x glaucifolia. There was also an unusual variant of Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei which has a distinctive lax, open branched, taller growth form and more densely hirsute, white-coloured leaves. The average number of total taxa is 31.5 ± 3.9 (s.e.) per quadrat, which is similar to that of Community type 3.

Western Australia,Goldfields,Johnston Range Vegetation Complexes (Banded Ironstone Formations),Johnston Range BIF,"All the vegetation units associated with the BIF and BIF outwash geology of the Johnston Range. Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Markey and Dillon (2011):                                             Community type 1: Casuarina pauper – Allocasuarina dielsiana – Eucalyptus woodlands on lower slopes and flats Location: Woodlands on lower slopes, valley flats and pediments surrounding outcropping ridges and hills of BIF. Quadrats were at low altitudes and among the lowest topographic positions. Substrate: BIF quartz and calcrete colluvium, over BIF and mafic (occasionally some ultramafic) bedrock. This community was associated with very low cover of exposed bedrock, low runoff scores and gentle inclines.
Structural description: Open woodlands to occasional trees, varyingly dominated or co-dominated by Casuarina pauper, Allocasuarina dielsiana or Eucalyptus spp. (E. concinna, E. salubris and/or E. oleosa subsp. oleosa). The understorey consisted of a mid to dense shrub layer that included Olearia muelleri, Acacia andrewsii, Eremophila pantonii, Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. angustifolia, Acacia erinacea, Acacia acanthoclada subsp. glaucescens, Alyxia buxifolia, Exocarpus aphylla and Senna artemisioides subsp. filifolia.

Myrtaceous and Lamiaceous low shrubs, such as Baeckea elderiana, Mirbelia microphylla and Prostanthera grylloana, are associated with the weathered laterite overlying massive BIF. Many of these dominant taxa were also significant indicator species.

Community type 5: Allocasuarina dielsiana open woodlands – Acacia shrublands on BIF upper slopes and crests. Location: High in the BIF landscape, usually on steep BIF ridge crests and upper slopes and occasionally ranging down to middle hillslopes. Substrate: On exposed massive BIF and weathered rocky
BIF and laterite substrates with skeletal soils and BIF colluvial deposits. Calcrete deposits were generally absent or occasionally present.  Structural description: Typically Allocasuarina dielsianaopen woodlands or isolated trees over tall shrublands of Acacia (A. quadrimarginea, A. cockertoniana and/or A. aneura). Mid stratum dominated by shrubs of Eremophila georgei, E. forrestii subsp. forrestii, Grevillea extorris, Dodonaea rigida, P. obovatus, P. brucei subsp. brucei, Sida ectogama and/or Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, over
lower stratum of isolated plants of Sida sp. dark green fruits, geophytes (Cheilanthes adiantoides) and sods of
Austrostipa scabra/nitida. Several of these dominant or common taxa were significant indicator species of this
community type.

Community type 6: Allocasuarina dielsiana woodlands, mallee shrublands or tall Acacia
shrublands on lower slopes and flats. Location: On mid to lower slopes, valley flats and
pediments of hilly, undulating BIF terrain. Substrate: Mainly BIF, laterite and weathered BIF colluvial
deposits, on deep (>50 cm) red sandy loams or clay loams, with no exposed bedrock and minimal runoff. Structural description: Woodlands, mallee shrublands or tall Acacia shrublands. Tall shrublands were commonly dominated by A. aneura and A. ramulosa var. ramulosa, and sometimes A. cockertoniana. Woodlands were usually dominated by A. dielsiana, while the most common mallee species were Eucalyptus ewartiana or Eucalyptus concinna. Callitris columellaris was an occasional emergent in the southern regions. The understorey shrub stratum included Olearia humilis, Senna artemisioides subsp filifolia, Cryptandra connata, Eremophila granitica, Bursaria occidentalis, Eremophila forrestii subsp. forrestii and Eremophila georgei. The sparse ground stratum included species of Austrostipa, Monachather paradoxus, Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi and Chamaexeros macranthera. Significant indicator species included A. aneura var. intermedia, A. ramulosa var. ramulosa, E. granitica and several grass taxa.",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Static (no change),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Info from workshop.

Many of these dominant taxa were also significant indicator species.

Community type 5: Allocasuarina dielsiana open woodlands – Acacia shrublands on BIF upper slopes and crests. Location: High in the BIF landscape, usually on steep BIF ridge crests and upper slopes and occasionally ranging down to middle hillslopes. Substrate: On exposed massive BIF and weathered rocky
BIF and laterite substrates with skeletal soils and BIF colluvial deposits. Calcrete deposits were generally absent or occasionally present.  Structural description: Typically Allocasuarina dielsianaopen woodlands or isolated trees over tall shrublands of Acacia (A. quadrimarginea, A. cockertoniana and/or A. aneura). Mid stratum dominated by shrubs of Eremophila georgei, E. forrestii subsp. forrestii, Grevillea extorris, Dodonaea rigida, P. obovatus, P. brucei subsp. brucei, Sida ectogama and/or Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, over
lower stratum of isolated plants of Sida sp. dark green fruits, geophytes (Cheilanthes adiantoides) and sods of
Austrostipa scabra/nitida. Several of these dominant or common taxa were significant indicator species of this
community type.

Community type 6: Allocasuarina dielsiana woodlands, mallee shrublands or tall Acacia
shrublands on lower slopes and flats. Location: On mid to lower slopes, valley flats and
pediments of hilly, undulating BIF terrain. Substrate: Mainly BIF, laterite and weathered BIF colluvial
deposits, on deep (>50 cm) red sandy loams or clay loams, with no exposed bedrock and minimal runoff. Structural description: Woodlands, mallee shrublands or tall Acacia shrublands. Tall shrublands were commonly dominated by A. aneura and A. ramulosa var. ramulosa, and sometimes A. cockertoniana. Woodlands were usually dominated by A. dielsiana, while the most common mallee species were Eucalyptus ewartiana or Eucalyptus concinna. Callitris columellaris was an occasional emergent in the southern regions. The understorey shrub stratum included Olearia humilis, Senna artemisioides subsp filifolia, Cryptandra connata, Eremophila granitica, Bursaria occidentalis, Eremophila forrestii subsp. forrestii and Eremophila georgei.

Substrate and location: Community type 1 was located on upland summit surfaces of BIF ridges, where parallel ridges and gently tilted BIF strata underlie relatively deep deposits of weathered, lateritic duricrusts. These are overlain with sandy soils and lateritic gravels. This community was located in the central to southern parts of the survey area, and was found at high elevations, on areas with low gradients and with low cover of exposed bedrock (<2%), with medium sized surface rocks and moderately shallow to deep soil depth categories. Soils were strongly acidic (pH <4.8), and had relatively high concentrations of organic C, N and Fe, relatively low concentrations of the most trace elements (particularly Ca, Co, K, Mg and Ni), and relatively lower average values for Na, EC1:5 and eCEC.
Structural description: Typically a mosaic of shrublands co-dominated varyingly by Acacia aneura, Allocasuarina eriochlamys subsp. eriochlamys, Banksia arborea, Acacia effusifolia, or open mallee shrublands or isolated mallees of Eucalyptus (E. ebbannoensis, E. ewartiana and E. horistes). Many of the common and characteristic species come from the Proteaceae, Myrtaceae and Lamiaceae, and include Prostanthera grylloana, Leucopogon sp. Clyde Hill (MA Burgman 1207), Olearia humilis, Grevillea paradoxa, Baeckea elderiana, Mirbelia microphylla, Prostanthera magnifica, Wrixonia prostantheroides, Grevillea oligomera, Baeckea elderiana and Aluta aspera subsp. aspera. Many of these were significant indicator species.

Community type 2: Banksia arborea – Acacia aneura – Acacia quadrimarginea shrublands on massive BIF
Substrate and location: Found on massive BIF outcrops on steep, rocky uplands. Located at notably high elevations and topographic locations, on steep slopes with moderate to large surface rocks, high runoff scores, a relatively high cover of exposed bedrock and notably skeletal soil depths. Soils were strongly acidic (pH <4.8), and values for many trace elements were relatively low.
Structural description: This community consisted of tall shrublands varyingly co-dominated by A. aneura, A. quadrimarginea, Allocasuarina acutivalvis and B. arborea. Other shrub taxa included Melaleuca leiocarpa, Philotheca brucei subsp. brucei, Dodonaea rigida, Eremophila georgei, Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei and Ptilotus obovatus. Common ground stratum species included both species of rock fern (Cheilanthes spp.) and Sida sp. Golden calyces (HN Foote 32). Many of these characteristic shrub and geophytic species were commonly found growing out of rock fissures.

Community type 3: Eucalyptus – Allocasuarina dielsiana woodlands and Acacia shrublands on mid- to upper hillslopes.
Substrate and location: Sites were generally located on middle to upper hillslopes at moderate elevations and with moderate gradients, among ridges of interbedded BIF and mafic lithologies. Sites had deposits of BIF and mafic scree, little bedrock outcrop cover, shallow soils and moderate runoff scores. Soils were weakly acidic, had moderately low in EC1:5 and Na values, and concentrations of trace elements in the middle range of values. Structural description: Tall Acacia shrublands usually codominated by A. aneura (A. aneura var. cf. intermedia or var cf. argentia), Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa and/or Acacia burkittii, and often overtopped by isolated trees of Allocasuarina dielsiana. Also open woodlands dominated by Eucalyptus (E. concinna or E. ebbanoensis subsp. glauciramula) or Allocasuarina dielsiana (sometimes also Casuarina pauper). Acacia aff. balsamea, Acacia duriuscula or A. quadrimarginea were occasionally co-dominants in the upper stratum. The middle stratum of sparse shrublands often included Scaevola spinescens, E. latrobei subsp. latrobei, D. rigida, Solanum ferocissimum, P. brucei subsp. brucei, E. georgei, Eremophila oldfieldii, Dodonaea lobulata and P. obovatus. Very few indicator species characterized this community.

Community type 4: Eucalyptus stricklandii – Casuarina pauper – Allocasuarina dielsiana woodlands
Substrate and location: Distributed on middle to lower slopes of ridges, low hills, hillocks and pediments. Found on colluvial deposits of BIF and mafic rocks, often with some deposits of calcrete. Sites were located at moderate elevations, on low gradients with little bedrock outcrop, shallow soils and moderate runoff scores. Soils were weakly acidic to neutral and average trace element concentrations and soil eCEC were relatively high, with comparatively higher salinity values (Na and EC1:5; Table 4).
Structural description: Woodlands dominated varying by Eucalyptus stricklandii, C. pauper and/or A. dielsiana,
over tall shrubs or Acacia (A. ramulosa subsp. ramulosa, A. burkittii, Acacia sibirica, A. quadrimargina). Common species included Santalum spicatum, Acacia erinacea, Eremophila sp. Mt Jackson (GJ Keighery 4372), Eremophila oldfieldii, D. lobulata, Alyxia buxifolia, S.spinescens, Olearia muelleri and P. obovatus, over
isolated chenopod subshrubs (Maireana and Sclerolaena) and the perennial speargrass, Austrostipa platychaeta.

Community type 6: Pediment and peneplain woodlands and shrublands
Substrate and location: Woodlands and shrublands on the pediments and peneplains flanking BIF ridges, on
colluvial deposits of BIF, calcrete, quartz and mafic fragments. Located at the lowest points in the landform,
where the gradient was low, surface rocks were small and soils were deep. Soils were weakly acidic, with relatively low values for both soil organic C and S, and moderate or high values for many soil trace elements.
Structural description: Predominately open woodlands co-dominated by varying combinations of A. dielsiana,
Eucalyptus longissima, Eucalyptus griffithsii, Callitriscolumellaris and C. pauper. Less frequently, quadrats
within this community were described as tall shrublands of Acacia (including A. ramulosa var. ramulosa and A.
burkittii). Dominant lower shrub stratum taxa were Olearia pimelioides, Senna artemisioides subsp. filifolia,
O. muelleri, P. obovatus and species of Maireana and Enchylaena. Many of these common taxa were characteristic of the community, as were Eremophila granitica, Cryptandra connata and Austrostipa

Western Australia,Midwest,Weld Range vegetation complexes (banded ironstone formation),Weld Range,"All the vegetation units associated with the BIF and BIF outwash geology of the Weld Range. Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Markey and Dillon (2008).          
 Community type 1a is typically dominated by Acacia aneura, A. ramulosa var linophylla, and / or Acacia sp. Weld Range (A. Markey & S. Dillon 2994) over a sparse shrub cover of Eremophila spp. Structurally, it consists of open shrublands on hillslopes with moderately inclined gradients, very rocky terrain and outcroping of BIF. This vegetation type occurred across the topographical profile of the range, from the lower slopes to hill tops, but was located mostly on the mid – upper slopes.  Significant indicator species include Eremophila glutinosa, Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei (which is also an indicator species for Community type 1b) and Santalum spicatum (a species with few occurrences but with most of these within Community type 1a).
Community type 1b typically consists of open shrublands and sparse shrublands of Acacia aneura (cf. var. microphylla, aneura and argentea), Acacia sp. Weld Range (A. Markey & S. Dillon 2994), and Grevillea berryana over a shrub layer of various species of Eremophila (E. georgei, E. latrobei subsp. latrobei and E. glutinosa). This community occurs mostly on rocky, gentle - moderate inclines, on higher slopes than type 1a. Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei and Thryptomene decussata are the only two significant indicator species. However, Ptilotus schwartzii, Ptilotus obovatus, Grevillea berryana, Eremophila georgei and Thysanotus manglesianus are also notable species within this community subtype. The characteristic of rocky ironstone species, Prostanthera petrophila and Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi are found to be both almost exclusive to Community type 1 (1a and 1b).
Community type 2 consists of sparse – open shrublands of Acacia aneura cf. var. microcarpa and/or A. aneura cf. var. aneura over the mid-stratum shrub layer which includes species such as Thryptomene decussata, Philotheca brucei subsp brucei and numerous species of Eremophila. This community is associated with massive outcrops and rocklands of BIF on moderate - steep hillslopes. Notable indicator species are Cheilanthes adiantoides, Philotheca brucei subsp. brucei, Micromyrtus sulphurea, Dodonaea pachyneura (also shared with Community type 4) and Stylidium longibracteatum. These species typically grow in crevices and fissures formed in exposed outcrops of bedrock. Other common species were Ptilotus obovatus subsp. obovatus and Harniera kempeana subsp. muelleri.
Community type 3  - depauperate shrublands are located on middle- and lower hillslopes on a moderate gradient (12°), with no outcropping BIF but an abundance of loose ironstone gravels and scree. The two sites sampled were both an open shrubland of Acacia aneura over isolated shrub species such as Solanum ashbyae and Tribulus suberosus. Only Cheilanthes cf. sieberi subsp. pseudovillea is identified as a significant indicator species of this community. However, the analysis was limited by the small sample size.
Community type 4 consists of open shrublands of Acacia aneura and emergent trees of Acacia pruinocarpa over shrublands of Philotheca brucei subsp. brucei and Eremophila spp. Only three sites are classified as this community type. The community is most similar to floristic community type 3, but is more species-rich and located further upslope on steep, rocky hillslopes with relatively high levels of exposed bedrock. The best indicator species include Abutilon oxycarpum, Dodonaea pachyneura and Enneapogon caerulescens, which are characteristic species of fractured rocky substrates.
Community type 5 has typically consists of open tall Acacia shrublands (Acacia pruinocarpa, Acacia aneura var. tenuis and Acacia ramulosa var. linophylla) mostly on lower slopes and outwashes of ironstone colluvium. 
Community type 5a consists of isolated, emergent trees of Acacia pruinocarpa above Acacia aneura / Acacia ramulosa var linophylla over an open mid-stratum of shrubs. This community is found on the gentle – moderately inclined lower hillslopes and outwash plains, with some low outcroppings of banded iron formation on the footslopes. Occasionally this unit is repeated on middle- and upper slopes. There are no significant indicator species unique to this community type, although Acacia aneura cf. var. tenuis has a moderate indicator value and was frequent within this community type. Acacia aneura cf. var. argentea, Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit (H.N. Foote 32) and Acacia pruinocarpa, distinguish this community type from Community type 5b.
Community type 5b is typically a sparse open Acacia shrubland (A. aneura cf. var. tenuis, A. aneura cf. var. aneura and / or Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. effusa) over sparse layer of shrubs of Senna spp. and Tribulus suberosus.

Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Markey and Dillon (2010).
Community type 1: BIF upland A. aneura/Acacia umbraculiformis/A. ramulosa shrublands. Community type 1 consists of sites from gently – moderately inclined upper hill slopes and crests of massive BIF or heavily weathered haematite, BIF and/or laterite.This community can be described generally as sparse
shrublands of A. aneura, A. umbraculiformis and Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa, over various shrubs, including
Grevillea obliquistigma, Santalum spicatum, Thryptomene decussata, Prostanthera althoferi subsp. althoferi, Sida ectogama Philotheca brucei, Eremophila latrobei subsp. latrobei, and Ptilotus obovatus. Significant indicator species for this community type include Dodonaea petiolaris, Acacia aneura var. cf. microcarpa, Cymbopogon ambiguus, Solanum ellipticum, Solanum lasiophyllum, Sida sp. dark green fruits (S. van Leeuwen 2260), Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi and Hakea recurva subsp. recurva. Other notable taxa include those that occupy rock fissures, such as the perennial herb, Stylidium longibracteatum and the myrtaceous shrub, Micromyrtus sulphurea.                                                                                                                          Community type 3: lowland Acacia ramulosa/Acacia grasbyi shrublands.  Community type 3 was assigned to nine sites located on substantial BIF ridges around Buddadoo and Murdaburia Hills and the northern section of Edamurta Range. These sites were flat to gently inclined stony plains at the base of the landforms or flat summit surfaces on BIF ridges. Community type 3 typically consisted of open tall shrublands of A. ramulosa var. ramulosa and A. grasbyi (an indicator species for this community), over open shrubland which includes of variety of shrubs, the most common including E. forrestii subsp. forrestii, Ptilotus drummondii var. drummondii and the significant indicator species Senna glutinosa subsp. chatelainiana, Spartothamnella teucriiflora, Sida ectogama, Senna charlesiana, Solanum ellipticum and Ptilotus obovatus. Chenopods are conspicuous in the lower shrub layers, including Maireana convexa, Maireana triptera and Sclerolaena densiflora.                                                                                                                       Community 4 was a heterogenous assemblage of nine quadrats located on gently inclined to undulating
lower hill slopes, pediments, breakaways and stony plains surrounding Murdaburia and Mugga Mugga Hills.
The underlying geology is weathered BIF, haematite, laterite and associated metasedimentary rocks, and this lowland landscape grades from rocky breakaway escarpments and low outcrops of BIF to a mosaic of open York gum (Eucalyptus loxophleba) woodlands and A. ramulosa var. ramulosa / A. burkittii shrublands on the lowest points in this landscape.                                                                                  Community type 4a: Eucalyptus loxophleba - Acacia ramulosa / Acacia burkittii woodland - shrubland mosaic
Community type 4a was represented by four sites on low weathered BIF pavements on pediments flanking the base of Mugga Mugga Hill. The typical community structure ranged from a mosaic of E. loxophleba subsp. supralaevis-A. ramulosa var. ramulosa woodland / shrublands to A. burkittii-A. ramulosa var. ramulosa tall open shrublands, often with A. umbraculiformis, over a very sparse stratum of various shrubs, including Acacia exocarpoides and Enchylaena lanata, over small tussocks of Austrostipa nitida, A. elegantissima and M. paradoxa. In addition to those already listed for Community type 4, A. exocarpoides is a significant indicator species for Community type 4a.

Community type 4b: Acacia ramulosa / Acacia burkittii / Eremophila oldfieldii chenopod shrublands
Community type 4b was sampled at both Mugga Mugga and Murdaburia Hills, and the species composition reflects the influence of the low outcrops of BIF, haematite and associated metasedimentary silts, shales and cherts. Sites were on lower slopes or flats downslope from BIF ridges or laterite breakaways, with evidence of calcrete deposition at some sites. The community typically consists of open all shrublands of A. ramulosa var. ramulosa, Acacia tetragonophylla and A. burkittii with isolated trees of Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. oldfieldii and Santalum spicatum, over a sparse shrub stratum of Senna sp. Austin (A. Strid 20210), Acacia andrewsii, Eremophila oppositifolia subsp. angustifolia, Dodonaea inaequifolia, P. obovatus, Scaevola spinescens and Eremophila pantonii. Common components of the lower shrub and grass stratum include Austrostipa scabra, Austrodanthonia caespitosa, A. elegantissima and the chenopods, Maireana thesioides, Sclerolaena diacantha, Maireana carnosa, E. lanata and S. densiflora.

Community type 1a occurs on ironstone substrates that were low in the landscape (at an average altitude of 361m), either on the lower slopes of hills, small massive outcrops of banded ironstone formation or low rises in the upland peneplains.  Common  and significant indicator species include Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. latior and Acacia sibiana in the dominant stratum, over the shorter shrubs, Aluta aspera subsp. hesperia, Eremophila forrestii subsp. forrestii, Philotheca desertii subsp. desertii and Hemigenia sp. Cue (K.F. Kenneally 47A). Eremophila latrobei subsp. Latrobei and the rockfern, Cheilanthes adiantoides are characteristic understorey species for both this community, and Community types 1b and 2. Being a lowland community, this community included emergent trees such as Callitris columellaris, Eucalyptus ewartiana, E. leptopoda, and open tall shrublands of Acacia (A. aneura, A. ramulosa var. ramulosa and A. coolgardiensis subsp. latior).
Community 3: consists of sparse shrublands on the crests and moderately steep slopes of low escarpments, ridges and outcrops of BIF. Sites are typically rocky and situated moderately high in the landscape (at an average altitude of 406 m).The underlying geology consists of both banded iron formation and paler, weathered sedimentary siltstones and cherts. Characteristic species include those which grow in fissures of exposed pavements of BIF such as Stylidium longibracteatum, Micromyrtus trudgenii and Calytrix uncinata. Also of note is Acacia aulacophylla, which replaces Acacia assimilis subsp. assimilis as a dominant shrub in the northern extent of the study site. Other notable and significant indicator species include Eremophila glutinosa, Melaleuca hamata (rarely encountered, with both occurrences in this community type), Austrodanthonia caespitosa, Mirbelia bursarioides, Cheiranthera filifolia var. simplicifolia, Drummondita fulva, Prostanthera patens and Thryptomene costata.      
Community 4b: appears to be restricted to the eastern regions of the survey area, on the slopes of Pinyalling, Walagnumming, Warriedar and Chulaar Hills. Although still rocky, this community occurs on gentle – moderate slopes with less exposed bedrock and more colluvium than Community type 4a. Structurally, the vegetation consists of tall shrublands of Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa or Acacia aneura with a sparse shrub understorey. This community type was located over the topographical profile of hills, from lower slopes to crests. Characteristic indicator species include Acacia aneura var. cf. major and Acacia umbraculiformis in the dominant stratum over the low shrubs and herbaceous perennials, Phyllanthus erwinii, Ptilotus drummondii var. drummondii, Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit (H.N. Foote 32), and Solanum ellipticum.   
Community 5a (BIF outwash geology): Community type 5a consists of open Eucalyptus woodlands and sparse Eremophila or Acacia shrublands over sparse, low chenopod shrubs. Being located in the depositional part of the landscape, this community receives colluvium from the adjacent uplands. The substrate consists of readily eroding siltstone, cherts, and other sedimentary rocks which have been exposed from under layers of more resistant BIF. The significant indicator species include Acacia erinacea, Enchylaena lanata/tomentosa, Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. oldfieldii, E. oppositifolia subsp. angustifolia, Senna sp. Austin, Maireana carnosa, and a number of species of Sclerolaena.",1,1 (potentially meets location criteria CR),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available following peer review,Static (no change),Expert opinion,Info from workshop.

Includes vegetation units identified on these geologies by Markey and Dillon (2008).                                                                                                                                         Community type 1a occurs on ironstone substrates that were low in the landscape (at an average altitude of 361m), either on the lower slopes of hills, small massive outcrops of banded ironstone formation or low rises in the upland peneplains. It is distributed from Mt Karara to the strikes of BIF north of Minjar Hill and east to the footslopes of Warriedar Hill, but was absent from the extreme south-east extent of the study area. Common and significant indicator species (Table 2) include Acacia coolgardiensis subsp. latior and Acacia sibiana in the dominant stratum, over the shorter shrubs, Aluta aspera subsp. hesperia, Eremophila forrestii subsp. forrestii, Philotheca desertii subsp. desertii and Hemigenia sp. Cue (K.F. Kenneally 47A). Eremophila latrobei subsp. Latrobei and the rockfern, Cheilanthes adiantoides are characteristic understorey species for both this community, and Community types 1b and 2. Being a lowland community,this community included emergent trees such as Callitris columellaris, Eucalyptus ewartiana, E. leptopoda, and open tall shrublands of Acacia (A. aneura, A. ramulosa var. ramulosa and A. coolgardiensis subsp. latior).
Community type 4a consists of open stands of Callitris collumelaris and sparse shrublands located at the highest points in the landscape on steep, rocky or boulder-strewn ridges, cliffs and tors with shallow, loamy soils. This community was found on the east-facing steep cliffs of Windaning Ridge, rocky upper slopes of Pinyalling Hill, two foothill sites on Mt Karara and on the metasedimentary rocks (psammitic and peltic – semi peltic) of Warriedar Hill (cf. Lipple et al. 1983). It is a very species rich community (54.8 ± 9.4 taxa per quadrat), with much of this richness being contributed by annuals. Notable and significant indicator species include those characteristic of rocky terrain, namely the shrubs Calycopeplus pauciflorus, Dodonaea petiolaris and Dodonaea viscosa, the rockferns, Cheilanthes sieberi subsp. sieberi, Cheilanthes lasiophyllum and Pleurosorus rutifolius and the herbaceous Isotoma petraea. The latter three species were infrequent but faithful to this community type.
Community type 4b appears to be restricted to the eastern regions of the survey area, on the slopes of Pinyalling, Walagnumming, Warriedar and Chulaar Hills. Although still rocky, this community occurs on gentle – moderate slopes with less exposed bedrock and more colluvium than Community type 4a. Structurally, the vegetation consists of tall shrublands of Acacia ramulosa var. ramulosa or Acacia aneura with a sparse shrub understorey. This community type was located over the topographical profile of hills, from lower slopes to crests. Characteristic indicator species include Acacia aneura var. cf. major and Acacia umbraculiformis in the dominant stratum over the low shrubs and herbaceous perennials, Phyllanthus erwinii, Ptilotus drummondii var. drummondii, Sida sp. Golden calyces glabrous fruit (H.N. Foote 32), and Solanum ellipticum.
Community 5a consists of open Eucalyptus woodlands and sparse Eremophila or Acacia shrublands over sparse, low chenopod shrubs. Being located in the depositional part of the landscape, this community receives colluvium from the adjacent uplands. The substrate consists of readily eroding siltstone, cherts, and other sedimentary rocks which have been exposed from under layers of more resistant BIF. This is a species rich community (53.1 ± 17.2 taxa per quadrat). Significant indicator species include Acacia erinacea, Enchylaena lanata / tomentosa, Eremophila oldfieldii subsp. oldfieldii, E. oppositifolia subsp. angustifolia, Senna sp. Austin, Maireana carnosa, and a number of species of Sclerolaena). This community was encountered on two distinctive footslope sites from Mt Karara and at various locations over Badja station (Pinyalling Hill).",3,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available but not peer reviewed,Static (no change),Quantitative analysis of data published or publically available but not peer reviewed,Info from workshop.

Community type 5: was found predominately on moderately inclined midslopes of hills and low, weathered, stoney rises and laterised breakaways. Rocks types were variable, and included massive and weathered BIF, mafic, gabbro, calcrete, banded chert and metasedimentary influences. This is a heterogenous assemblage of sites, with a suggestion of two variants within the community. One variant consists of shrublands on rocky pediments and midslopes, and consists of shrublands varying dominated by Acacia ramulosa, Acacia
burkittii, Acacia tetragonophylla and Eremophila oldfieldii over Eremophila granitica, Rhagodia eremaea and chenopod subshrubs (Maireana, Sclerolaena and Enchylaena) and Austrostipa spp. The second group consisted of more sparse, open shrublands of Acacia burkittii, Eremophila oldfieldii over Hakea preissii, Rhagodia eremaea, Senna sp.

Many of these taxa were significant indicator species.                                                                                               Community type 3a: Gnows Nest Range Acacia aneura – Acacia ramulosa mid- to lower-slope shrublands on rocky middle to lower slopes on weathered BIF. Characteristically depauperate understorey under a canopy dominated by Acacia. Tall shrublands of A. aneura and A. ramulosa var. ramulosa, over a sparse shrub stratum of E. latrobei subsp. latrobei, E. forrestii subsp. forrestii and Eremophila georgei. The sparse ground layer usually consisted of isolated plants of P. schwartzii/drummondii and Monachather paradoxa. Indicator species analysis only found E. forrestii subsp. forrestii as significant.                                          Community type 3b: Acacia ramulosa – Acacia grasbyi lowland to colluvial flat shrublands on depositional areas around BIF ridges.  Sparse, tall Acacia shrublands, co-dominated by combinations of A. ramulosa var.
ramulosa, Acacia grasbyi, Acacia tetragonophylla and A. aneura. The shrub understorey included Eremophila
galeata, Eremophila demissa, E. forrestii subsp. forrestii, Maireana planifolia and Ptilotus obovatus. The ground layer included isolated clumps of Monachather paradoxus and Austrostipa elegantissima. There were relatively few indicator species for this community, including Dianella revoluta var. divaricata and Rhyncharrhena linearis.                                                                                                        Community type 4: Acacia burkittii – Acacia umbraculiformis shrublands on low BIF/mafic hills. Tall, open shrublands codominated to varying degrees by Acacia burkittii, A. aneura and A. umbraculiformis. Other common or typical taxa included A. tetragonophylla, Sida ectogama, Solanum ellipticum, M. planifolia and Sida sp. dark green fruit (S van Leeuwen 2260). The ground layer included isolated clumps Austrostipa elegantissima. Best indicator species for this community included Acacia speckii, Solanum
lasiophyllum, P. obovatus and Eremophila galeata.                                                                 Community type 5: was found predominately on moderately inclined midslopes of hills and low, weathered, stoney rises and laterised breakaways. Rocks types were variable, and included massive and weathered BIF, mafic, gabbro, calcrete, banded chert and metasedimentary influences. This is a heterogenous assemblage of sites, with a suggestion of two variants within the community. One variant consists of shrublands on rocky pediments and midslopes, and consists of shrublands varying dominated by Acacia ramulosa, Acacia
burkittii, Acacia tetragonophylla and Eremophila oldfieldii over Eremophila granitica, Rhagodia eremaea and chenopod subshrubs (Maireana, Sclerolaena and Enchylaena) and Austrostipa spp. The second group consisted of more sparse, open shrublands of Acacia burkittii, Eremophila oldfieldii over Hakea preissii, Rhagodia eremaea, Senna sp. Austin and chenopod subshrubs, including Maireana trichoptera and Atriplex semilunaris. Many of these notable taxa are characteristic of this community type, including several species of chenopods subshrubs.",4,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Static (no change),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Info from workshop.

Western Australia,Pilbara,Roebourne Plains coastal grasslands with gilgai microrelief on deep cracking clays ,Roebourne Plains gilgai grasslands,"Roebourne Plains coastal grasslands with gilgai micro-relief occurs on deep clays that are self mulching cracking clays that emerge on depositional surfaces. These gilgai cracking clay plains support mostly annual tussock grasses (Sorghum sp.) and ephemeral herbs dominated by Papilionaceae (Desmodium spp. and Glycine sp.). The Roebourne Plains are somewhat saline and have two components: heavy gilgai (cracking clay); and light clay plains. 

The community extends west from the Cape Preston Hills, running along the northern side of North West Coastal Highway to the mouth of Whim Creek at Balla Balla in the east. It extends inland towards Pyramid Hills, but not beyond the hills. The community has been a focus for grazing, and has been severely degraded by past land practices including heavy grazing, and development for mining and associated infrastructure. The gilgai depressions support ephemeral and perennial tussock grasslands dominated by Sorghum sp. and Eragrostis xerophila (Roebourne Plains grass) along with other native species including Astrebla pectinata (barley mitchell grass), Eriachne benthamii (swamp wanderrie grass), Chrysopogon fallax (golden beard grass) and Panicum decompositum (native millet). It differs from the surrounding clay flats of the Horseflat land system which are dominated by Eragrostis xerophila and other perennial tussock (Eragrostis mostly) grass species. It differs from other cracking clay communities in respect to the representation of tussock grasses in nearby Chichester and Mungaroona Ranges. These appear higher in the landscape, and are sometimes perched on hill tops and plateaus. The Roebourne Plains gilgai grasslands also differs markedly from the West Angelas Cracking Clays that consist of ephemeral tussock and annual grasses on cracking-clay loam depressions and flow lines derived from basalts (Jerrinah Formation).",24,Greater than 20 (does not meet IUCN location criteria),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Loss of occurrences (new knowledge - delineation/mapping),Expert opinion,"JM: this info from workshop, loss due to better mapping.

Western Australia,Pilbara,Weeli Wolli Spring Community,Weeli Wolli ,"Unusual flora assemblages as sympatric Gossypium spp. Hybridising. Undscibed aquatic crustaceans collected form this site. High diversity of flora. Weeli Wolli Spring appears superficially to be a typical spring site in the Pilbara.  However, the site is an area of high floristic richness as a result of the varied geology and landscape, and the system is a good representation of Pilbara riparian habitat. In addition there are several rare, threatened and/or endangered species in the habitat.

The vegetation associations present at Weeli Wolli Spring resemble riparian vegetation found throughout the Hamersley Range and inland Pilbara, and are dominated by an open to moderately dense woodland of Eucalyptus camaldulensis (River Red Gum) over scattered E. victrix (Coolabah) and Acacia citrinoviridis (black mulga). In areas of surface water expression or near surface watertables a forest community comprising E. camaldulensis and Melaleuca argentea (silver cadjeput) over Atalaya hemiglauca (white wood) dominates. In terms of vegetation associations, the spring's riparian woodland and forest associations are unusual as a consequence of the composition of the understorey (van Leewen 2000). 

The sedge and herbfield communities that fringe many of the pools and associated water bodies along the main channels of Weeli Wolli Creek have not been recorded from other wetland sites in the Pilbara, probably because of difference in the hydrological processes, streambed gradients, water flow rates and because of the deleterious impacts of trampling and grazing by livestock elsewhere (van Leeuwin 2000).

Western Australia,Pilbara,Tanpool Land System,Tanpool ,"A highly restricted land system that occurs between Pannawonica and Onslow. Consists of stony plains and low ridges of sandstone and other sedimentary rocks supporting hard spinifex grasslands and snakewood shrublands. Geology is Proterozoic sandstone, siltstone and shale; uaterary colluvium, eluvium and alluvium. Geomorphology is mainly erosional surfaces; stony plains low prominent strike ridges and low hills with short footslopes and sparse tributary drainage lines. Relief up to 40m. Land management: Hard spinifex vegetation on the system is not preferred by livestock. However, the snakewood communities include low shrubs and tussock grasses which are moderately to highly preferred, and are prone to degradation if overgrazed. Generally the system is not susceptible to erosion. Vegetation on the Land System was graded from very good 55%, good 15%< fair 15%, poor 15%. The total area of the land system is 6,843 ha.    

The Land system comprises of:

 25% Ridges and hills - ridges and low hills up to 10 km long with rounded crests and short moderately  inclined upper slopes; surface mantles of abundant to very abundant pebbles and cobbles of sandstone or other sedimentary rocks, also outcrops of parent rock. Relief up to 35 m. Occurs on stony soils (203). Vegetation comprises hummock grasslands of Triodia wiseana, T. brizoides, (hard spinifex) with very scattered shrubs such as Acacia ancistrocarpa (shiny leaf wattle) and A. atkinsiana (HSPG).

15% Footslopes - very gently inclined slopes extending for up to 600 m below unit 1, surface mantles of  abundant pebbles and cobbles of sandstone and other sedimentary rocks. Occurs on red shallow sandy duplex soil (406). Vegetation comprises scattered mid height shrublands of Acacia xiphophylla (snakewood) and sparse low shrubs mostly Senna spp. and patchy hard spinifex Triodia wiseana (PHSG).

55% Stony plains - level to very gently undulating plains up to 3 km in extent, surface mantles of abundant to very abundant pebbles of sandstone and other rocks, occasional patches with stony gilgai microrelief. Occurs on red deep loamy duplex soils (506), deep red/brown non-cracking clays (622) and some self-mulching cracking clays (602). Vegetation comprises hummock grasslands of Triodia wiseana with isolated to very scattered Acacia spp. shrubs (PHSG). Also very scattered to scattered tall or mid height shrublands of Acacia xiphophylla with sparse low shrubs and patchy hard spinifex Triodia wiseana and tussock grasses Eragrostis xerophila (Roebourne Plains grass) (ASHS, SSTS).

Western Australia,South Coast,Albany Blackbutt (Eucalyptus staeri) mallee heath on deep sand,Albany Blackbutt on deep sand,"The structure of the vegetation is mallee heath. Eucalyptus staeri to about 4-5 m in height is the most
common mallee within a tall open shrub layer consistently dominated by Agonis
theiformis and Banksia baxteri. Banksia attenuata, Banksia coccinea, Hakea pandanicarpa subsp.
crassifolia and Lambertia inermis are also dominant in some occurrences. Banksia attenuata dominates this
assemblage at occurrences with the deepest sand. Hakea baxteri and Nuytsia floribunda are
other common species in the tall shrub layer. Banksia baxteri in the tall shrubs layer is a conspicuous
indicator species of this unit.
The heath layer between 1 and 2 m in height is almost always very dense (30-70% foliage cover) and
is dominated in many sites by Banksia baueri, Beaufortia empetrifolia, Dryandra mucronulata subsp.
mucronulata, Dryandra plumosa subsp. plumosa, Hakea pandanicarpa subsp. crassifolia, Melaleuca
striata or Taxandria spathulata. Other common associates include Acacia subcaerulea, Banksia nutans
var. nutans, Melaleuca thymoides, Agonis theiformis, Hakea corymbosa subsp. corymbosa, Nuytsia
floribunda and Petrophile divaricata.
The shrubs less than 1 m in height are also very dense and extremely species rich but, with the
exception of the dominants Beaufortia empetrifolia and Adenanthos cuneatus, most individual species
occurred at very low abundance amongst the mid-dense cover of sedges and herbs. Characteristic low
shrubs of this assemblage included Bossiaea praetermissa, Calytrix flavescens, Franklandia fucifolia,
Stachystemon polyandrus and Verticordia sieberi var. lomata. Occurrences that have been recently burnt tend to be dominated by Acacia luteola, Grevillea fasciculata, Jacksonia capitata and Kennedia
coccinea. (The latter species are however rare or absent in the long unburnt sites.) Adenanthos cuneatus
in the low shrub layer is a conspicuous indicator species of this unit as it is rarely present in the other
vegetation units of this area. The ground cover was generally open sedges and herbs, particularly Anarthria scabra but also includes
Chordifex crispatus, Cyathochaeta equitans, Lomandra hastilis, Lepidosperma squamatum, Schoenus
caespititius, S. curvifolius, S. sublateralis and Tricostularia neesii var. elatior In addition a variety of
native and exotic grasses occur in this complex, including Amphipogon amphipogonoides,
Amphipogon avenaceus, Austrodanthonia caespitosa, *Aira caryophyllea, *Ehrharta longiflora,
*Hordeum leporinum and *Lagurus ovatus. This vegetation is characteristic of landforms and soils that are very common on the Pallinup Sand Plain and can still be seen as remnants throughout the sand plain. It was probably abundant, widespread and present in large expanses in the past. As it is present on infertile sands, some of this vegetation has been left uncleared on farms. However, many remnants on farms are degraded to varying degrees due to grazing, burning, trampling and nutrient enrichment by livestock. It is currently reserved in Mettler Lane Nature Reserve and Hassell National Park.

Western Australia,South Coast,Mosaic of Albany Blackbutt (Eucalyptus staeri) mallee-heath found on lateritic ridges and Chittick (Lambertia inermis subsp. inermis) scrub-heath on seasonally-waterlogged laterite,Albany Blackbutt on lateritic ridges,"This assemblage is restricted to the large bushland remnant situated in the east of the
mining lease (Figure 4.2). It occurred on the tallest ridge of the area (from about 140 to 160 AHD) on
shallow, well-drained soils with outcropping ferrugineous rocks.
The structure of the vegetation was generally very open mallee with open tall shrubs over closed heath.
Eucalyptus staeri (to about 4-5 m in height) was usually the only mallee (Plate 4.1) within a layer of tall
open shrubs over 2 m in height dominated by Agonis theiformis, Lambertia inermis and sometimes Hakea
pandanicarpa subsp. crassifolia.
The thickest layer of vegetation in this unit generally comprised shrubs from 1-2 m in height with a
foliage cover of 30-70%. Dominant species were generally Agonis theiformis, Banksia nutans var. nutans,
Beaufortia empetrifolia, Dryandra mucronulata subsp. mucronulata, Melaleuca striata, Petrophile
divaricata or Taxandria spathulata. Other shrubs characteristic of this assemblage in this height class
included Calothamnus gracilis, Dryandra cuneata, Hakea corymbosa subsp. corymbosa and
Xanthorrhoea platyphylla.
Low shrubs below 1 m in height were very species-rich but not abundant and there were no clearly
dominant species in this layer. These shrubs commonly included Isopogon attenuatus, Acacia delphina,
Astroloma drummondii, Andersonia simplex, Calytrix flavescens, Gompholobium knightianum,
Gompholobium venustum, Hibbertia lineata, Hovea trisperma, Isopogon attenuatus, Pultenaea
verruculosa and Tetratheca pubescens.
Sedges and herbs were a minor component in the sparse lower layer. Most abundant were Anarthria
prolifera, Mesomelaena stygia and Tricostularia neesii var. elatior. Other characteristic taxa of this
assemblage were Desmocladus fasciculatus, Harperia confertospicata, Hypolaena fastigiata and
Lepidosperma squamatum.
The mean species richness of these sites was 61.25 taxa per 10 m x 10 m quadrat, with a total of 115 taxa
recorded within the assemblage. These sites were all in excellent condition.

ESP01,South Coast,Mosaic of Albany Blackbutt (Eucalyptus staeri) mallee-heath found on lateritic ridges and Chittick (Lambertia inermis subsp. inermis) scrub-heath on seasonally-waterlogged laterite,Albany Blackbutt on lateritic ridges,"This assemblage is restricted to the large bushland remnant situated in the east of the
mining lease (Figure 4.2). It occurred on the tallest ridge of the area (from about 140 to 160 AHD) on
shallow, well-drained soils with outcropping ferrugineous rocks.
The structure of the vegetation was generally very open mallee with open tall shrubs over closed heath.
Eucalyptus staeri (to about 4-5 m in height) was usually the only mallee (Plate 4.1) within a layer of tall
open shrubs over 2 m in height dominated by Agonis theiformis, Lambertia inermis and sometimes Hakea
pandanicarpa subsp. crassifolia.
The thickest layer of vegetation in this unit generally comprised shrubs from 1-2 m in height with a
foliage cover of 30-70%. Dominant species were generally Agonis theiformis, Banksia nutans var. nutans,
Beaufortia empetrifolia, Dryandra mucronulata subsp. mucronulata, Melaleuca striata, Petrophile
divaricata or Taxandria spathulata. Other shrubs characteristic of this assemblage in this height class
included Calothamnus gracilis, Dryandra cuneata, Hakea corymbosa subsp. corymbosa and
Xanthorrhoea platyphylla.
Low shrubs below 1 m in height were very species-rich but not abundant and there were no clearly
dominant species in this layer. These shrubs commonly included Isopogon attenuatus, Acacia delphina,
Astroloma drummondii, Andersonia simplex, Calytrix flavescens, Gompholobium knightianum,
Gompholobium venustum, Hibbertia lineata, Hovea trisperma, Isopogon attenuatus, Pultenaea
verruculosa and Tetratheca pubescens.
Sedges and herbs were a minor component in the sparse lower layer. Most abundant were Anarthria
prolifera, Mesomelaena stygia and Tricostularia neesii var. elatior. Other characteristic taxa of this
assemblage were Desmocladus fasciculatus, Harperia confertospicata, Hypolaena fastigiata and
Lepidosperma squamatum.
The mean species richness of these sites was 61.25 taxa per 10 m x 10 m quadrat, with a total of 115 taxa
recorded within the assemblage. These sites were all in excellent condition.

The wetlands are described as bogs by Keighery and Beard. The wetland deposits are peat and the water is fresh. Soils are organic peaty sandy clay loam on shale and quartzite with quartz gravel. Vegetation consists of mallee-heath, thicket, and low woodland over sedge. Dominant species included Eucalyptus megacarpa, Allocasuarina decussata, Homalospermum firmum, Astartea sp staminodes, Agonis linearifolia, Xanthorrhoea preissii, Lepidosperma longitudinale and Gahnia  decomposita. The threatened flora species Xyris exilis (En) is restricted to the community and grows adjacent to creeklines and seepages. Other Priority flora taxa which occur within the community are Gonocarpus benthamii sp Stirling (P2), Stylidium keigheryi (P2), Calothamnus crassus (P4), Sollya drummondii (P4) and Velleia foliosa (P4). Frog species recorded from this wetland  include Geocrinia laeai, Ranidella pseudinsignifera, R. subinsignifera,  Limnodynastes dorsalis and Crinia georgiana.

A mallee-heath in which the conspicuous Eucalyptus pleurocarpa is the dominanat eucalypt species in an open mallee or vey open formation that typically includes abundant E. decipiens subsp. Adesmophloia and E. falacata. Eucalyptus buprestium, E. decurva and E. uncinata are also sometimes present. Hakea cucullata, H. nitida and H. pandanicarpa subsp. Crassifolia are usually present as tall open shrubs. The most dense layer in this vegetation unit is either shrubs between 1-2m height or altenatively shrubs less than 1m in height. Commonly, these heaths or closed heaths are dominated by Acacia biflora, Beaufortia empetrifolia, Dryandra mucronulata subsp. Mucronulata, Drynadra tenuifolia var. tenuifolia, Hakea denticulara, Isopogon trilobus, Melaleuca striata, Rinzia schollerifolia or Taxandria spathulata. Other characteristic species of this layer are Allocasuarina thuyoides, Andersonia sprengeloides, Conothamnus aureus, Leucopogon gibbosus, Malaleuca suberosa, Melaleuca subtrigona and Verticordia habrantha. A distinctive herb of this assemblage includes Anarthria gracilis, Chordifex sphacelatus, Desmocladus fasiculatus and Mesomelaena stygia along with the grasses Amphipogon amphipogonoides and Neurachne alopecuroides. This vegetation was probably originally present adjacent to most of the laterite formations

Western Australia,Kimberley,Assemblages of Point Spring and Long Spring rainforest swamps,Point Spring and Long Swamp,"Closed canopy rainforest on freshwater swamps on alluvial floodplain soils in the east Kimberley (Point Spring and Long Swamp).  Two occurrences are known, these are Point Spring and Long Swamp.  At Point Spring the canopy is 17m high and the dominant tree species include Canarium australianum, Carallia brachiata, Euodia elleryana, Ficus racemosa, F. virens and Terminalia sericocarpa.  Along one edge, the Point Spring rainforest extends on to the footslopes of a sandstone ridge and the spring feeds a small lake on the other side (Burbidge et al. 1991, McKenzie et al. 1991).  The rainforest canopy height at Long Swamp is 30m, and the dominant tree species include Nauclea orientalis, Terminalia sericocarpa and Euodia elleryana.  The periphery of the patch is permanently moist and supports a Melaleuca leucadendra forest (McKenzie et al. 1991).  At Point Spring the community species richness is 45, at Long Swamp it is 52.  The perennial plant species richness at Point Spring is 31, and at Long Swamp is 20.  Plants with very restricted distributions within the State include Dicliptera ciliata (herb) at Point Spring, and Mucuna gigantea (vine) and Sterculia holtzei (tree) at Long Swamp.  The lithology at both sites is quaternary alluvium and the soil is a black.  Subsurface soils are recorded as sandy-loam at Point Spring, and silty clay at Long Swamp.  In 1987, leaf litter depth was recorded as 5cm at Point Spring, and 15cm at Long Swamp (McKenzie et al. 1991).  Most of the camaenid land snails recorded in the Kimberley Rainforest Survey are restricted endemics in the Kimberley.  The median linear range for a wet area Kimberley camaenid is 20km, and 82 of the 93 camaenids were only collected in 1 to 5 patches (Solem 1991).  Consequently, these communities can be distinguished from similar rainforest communities elsewhere in northern Australia (Mr N.  McKenzie pers. comm. 2000).  In reference to Point Spring, Burbidge et al. (1991), described patches of closed canopy rainforest as so rare in the lowland environments of east Kimberley, that a variety of species depend on them for their persistence in the district.",2,Less than or equal to 5 (potentially meets location criteria EN),Quantitative analysis of data not publically available,Static (no change),Expert opinion,JM: Point Spring included in Audit 1,2449,"< 10,000ha (potentially meets extent of occurrence criteria for CR) ",Minimum convex polygon of records in DPaW corporate database,Static (no change),Kimberley workshop ,14,< 100ha (potentially meets area of occupancy criteria for CR),Sum of mapped polygons,Expanding (recovery actions > pressures),Kimberley workshop ,5 to 30% area subject to pressures/threats,Improving condition (recovery actions > pressures),Low severity,Improving condition (recovery actions > pressures),Expert opinion,Kimberley workshop (improving in condition due to destocking),5 to 30% area subject to pressures/threats,Improving condition (recovery actions > pressures),Low severity,Improving condition (recovery actions > pressures),Expert opinion,Kimberley workshop (improving in condition due to destocking),wetland,,,None,Priority 1,,,VIB01,DEC managed land - other ,,2012,"JM: cross ref wetlands section, Long Swamp and Point Spring added but referred to here for threats and management",Weeds (specify dominant spp):,,Weeds (specify dominant spp):,,none,,,,IN vi) Occurrences and boundaries of ecological communities,ground truthing required,EV iv) Develop/implement monitoring and evaluation and reporting plan ,,CP iv) Wetland management plan (specify),wetland management plan required,MD vi) Habitat restoration (specify),"fencing of remaining vine thickets, move stock watering points",MI iii) Habitat management through informal or complementary conservation mechanisms (specify),management of pastoral lease,,,Tenure is Non DEC leasehold.

Western Australia,multiple,Subtropical and Temperate Coastal Saltmarsh,Coastal Saltmarsh,"Consists of the assemblage of plants, animals and micro-organisms associated with saltmarsh in coastal regions of sub-tropical and temperate Australia (south of 23o S latitude). The habitat is coastal areas under tidal influence. In southern latitudes saltmarsh are the dominant habitat in the intertidal zone and often occur in association with estuaries. It is typically restricted to the upper intertidal environment, generally between the elevation of the mean high tide, and the mean spring tide. The community consists mainly of salt-tolerant vegetation (halophytes) including: grasses, herbs, reeds, sedges and shrubs. Succulent herbs and grasses generally dominate and vegetation is generally <0.5m tall with the exception of some reeds and sedges. Many species of non-vascular plants are also found in saltmarsh, including epiphytic algae, diatoms and cyanobacterial mats. Saltmarsh consists of many vascular plant species but is dominated by relatively few families. There is also typically a high degree of endemism at the species level. The two most widely represented coastal saltmarsh plant families are the Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae. Four structural saltmarsh forms are currently recognised based on dominance of a particular vegetation type: • dominance by succulent shrubs (e.g. Tecticornia) • dominance by grasses (e.g. Sporobolus virginicus) • dominance by sedges and grasses (e.g. Juncus kraussii, Gahnia trifida) • dominance by herbs (e.g. low-growing creeping plants such as Wilsonia backhousei, Samolus repens, Schoenus nitens).",215,Greater than 20 (does not meet IUCN location criteria),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,S&C: number of occurrences.

WAR01,South Coast,Subtropical and Temperate Coastal Saltmarsh,Coastal Saltmarsh,"Consists of the assemblage of plants, animals and micro-organisms associated with saltmarsh in coastal regions of sub-tropical and temperate Australia (south of 23o S latitude). The habitat is coastal areas under tidal influence. In southern latitudes saltmarsh are the dominant habitat in the intertidal zone and often occur in association with estuaries. It is typically restricted to the upper intertidal environment, generally between the elevation of the mean high tide, and the mean spring tide. The community consists mainly of salt-tolerant vegetation (halophytes) including: grasses, herbs, reeds, sedges and shrubs. Succulent herbs and grasses generally dominate and vegetation is generally <0.5m tall with the exception of some reeds and sedges. Many species of non-vascular plants are also found in saltmarsh, including epiphytic algae, diatoms and cyanobacterial mats. Saltmarsh consists of many vascular plant species but is dominated by relatively few families. There is also typically a high degree of endemism at the species level. The two most widely represented coastal saltmarsh plant families are the Chenopodiaceae and Poaceae. Four structural saltmarsh forms are currently recognised based on dominance of a particular vegetation type: • dominance by succulent shrubs (e.g. Tecticornia) • dominance by grasses (e.g. Sporobolus virginicus) • dominance by sedges and grasses (e.g. Juncus kraussii, Gahnia trifida) • dominance by herbs (e.g. low-growing creeping plants such as Wilsonia backhousei, Samolus repens, Schoenus nitens).",40,Refer to State level,Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,Increase in occurrences (new knowledge - biological survey/mapping),Quantitative unpublished data and expert opinion,S&C: number of occurrences.
