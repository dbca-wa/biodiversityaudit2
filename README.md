# biodiversity-explorer
An interactive web portal to explore the conservation status, threats, and management of Western Australia's biodiversity assets.

This project contains a static webpage (with JSONP queries fetching data from a CKAN data catalogue).

## Dual Purpose
This project serves two purposes. Firstly, it makes information about the conservation status and trends of Western Australian biodiversity assets available to decision makers and planners. The data that are shown live in a CKAN data catalogue. In this case, the data are sourced from an intranet-only CKAN instance and will only be visible to visitors from inside the intranet of the Department of Parks and Wildlife, Western Australia.

Secondly, it serves as an example of summarising and visualising data from CKAN, and how to access the API. Although an external viewer will not see any data, the code will demonstrate how to access and summarise GeoJSON, CSV (through the datastore API) and other data from CKAN.
